        "-----\n",
        "\n",
        "Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text summarization involves the use of computational techniques to understand, interpret, and generate concise and meaningful summaries of longer text documents. This process typically includes several key stages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Text Preprocessing:** Before summarizing, the text needs to be cleaned and prepared. This involves removing irrelevant data, normalizing text, and possibly parsing it into sentences or tokens.\n",
        "2. **Understanding Context:** NLP models must understand the context and main ideas of the text. This is often achieved through techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, and dependency parsing.\n",
        "3. **Feature Extraction:** The model identifies key features and important sentences or phrases. Techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or newer neural network-based approaches are used for this purpose.\n",
        "4. **Summarization Techniques:** There are two main types:\n",
        "  - Extractive Summarization: This method involves selecting and compiling key sentences from the original text to form a summary. It's simpler but may lack coherence.\n",
        "  - **Abstractive Summarization:** More complex, this method involves generating new sentences that capture the essence of the original text, often using advanced models like sequence-to-sequence neural networks.\n",
        "5. **Refinement:** The generated summary is often refined for coherence, fluency, and conciseness. This might involve rephrasing or restructuring sentences.\n",
        "6. **Evaluation:** The quality of the summary is evaluated using metrics like ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation), which compares the generated summary with a human-written reference summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advancements in deep learning, especially models like BERT, GPT, and their variants, have significantly improved the quality of text summarization, making it more accurate and human-like. These technologies have wide applications, from news aggregation to generating executive reports from extensive documents."

        "\n",
        "1. **Efficiency in Information Handling:** With the vast amount of textual data available online and in corporate databases, it becomes impractical to read and comprehend everything. Text summarization can condense this information, allowing users to understand content quickly.\n",
        "2. **Time-Saving:** Summarization significantly reduces the time required to get the gist of a document. This is especially valuable in sectors like legal, academic, and business, where professionals need to process large volumes of text daily.\n",
        "3. **Enhanced Accessibility:** Summarization makes information more accessible. For instance, it can help people with reading difficulties, or those who are not fluent in a particular language, to understand the content more easily.\n",
        "4. **Improved Decision Making:** In business and research, executives and scientists can make better-informed decisions when they can quickly access the summarized essence of extensive reports, research papers, or data analyses.\n",
        "5. **Content Curation and Recommendation:** Summarization can be used to curate content tailored to individual preferences, enhancing user experience in apps and websites by providing brief overviews of articles, papers, or books.\n",
        "6. **Knowledge Management and Retrieval:** Summarized texts can be more effectively indexed and retrieved, improving the functionality of search engines and knowledge management systems.\n",
        "7. **Support for Automated Reporting:** In journalism, finance, and weather forecasting, among other fields, text summarization can aid in generating automated reports, saving time and resources.\n",
        "8. **Educational Purposes:** Summarization tools can assist students and educators by providing concise summaries of educational material, aiding in study and revision.\n",
        "9. **Language Processing Research:** Summarization challenges NLP technologies to comprehend and reproduce human language more effectively, driving advancements in AI and machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "By leveraging NLP for text summarization, organizations and individuals can manage, interpret, and utilize textual data more effectively, making informed decisions and staying informed in a fast-paced world."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during the session, you will need to press *1 on your telephone. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\\n\\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet’s Third Quarter 2023 Earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat. Now I’ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor.\\n\\nSome of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.\\n\\nActual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Form 10-K, including our risk factor section and our Form 10-Qs. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\\n\\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.\\n\\nOur comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. And now I’ll turn the call over to Sundar.\\n\\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Jim. And hello, everyone.\\n\\nI’m pleased with our business results this quarter, which demonstrate strong growth in Search and YouTube, and momentum in Cloud.\\n\\nGoogle turned 25 in September, which offered an opportunity to reflect on our progress over the last quarter century, and to look ahead to the opportunities enabled by AI we are so excited and confident about.\\n\\nOur product momentum continued this quarter, as you saw with Cloud Next, Made on YouTube and Made by Google. It’s all part of our focus on making AI more helpful for everyone, and we are making good progress across the four areas that we shared last quarter.\\n\\nFirst, improving knowledge and learning. This includes our work with the Search Generative Experience, which is our experiment to bring generative AI capabilities into Search.\\n\\nWe’ve learned a lot from people trying it, and we’ve added new capabilities, like incorporating videos and images into responses and generating imagery. We’ve also made it easier to understand and debug generated code.\\n\\nDirect user feedback has been positive, with strong growth in adoption.\\n\\nIn August, we opened up availability to India and Japan, with more countries and languages to come.\\n\\nAs we add features and expand into new markets, we’re engaging with the broader ecosystem and will continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users, send valuable traffic to publishers, and support a healthy, open Internet.\\n\\nWith generative AI applied to Search, we can serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives.\\n\\nWe are surfacing more links with SGE, and linking to a wider range of sources on the results page, creating new opportunities for content to be discovered.\\n\\nOf course, ads will continue to play an important role in this new Search experience. People are finding ads helpful here, as they provide useful options to take action and connect with businesses.\\n\\nWe’ll experiment with new formats native to SGE that use generative AI to create relevant, high-quality ads, customized to every step of the search journey.\\n\\nThe second area we are focused on is boosting creativity and productivity. Bard is particularly helpful here; it’s a direct interface to a conversational LLM, and we think of it as an early experiment and complementary experience to Google Search.\\n\\nBard can now integrate with Google apps and services, showing relevant information from Workspace, Maps, YouTube, and Google Flights and hotels.\\n\\nWe’ve also improved the “Google it” feature. It provides other sources to help people evaluate Bard’s responses and explore information across the web.\\n\\nEarlier this month, we announced Assistant with Bard -- a personal assistant powered by generative AI. It combines Bard’s generative and reasoning capabilities with Assistant’s personalized help. You can interact with it through text, voice or images, and in the coming months, you’ll be able to opt in on Android and iOS mobile devices.\\n\\nOur collaborative tools in Workspace and YouTube are also part of how we boost creativity and productivity, and they are seeing great initial traction.\\n\\nThird, we are enabling developers, businesses and other organizations to build their own transformative products and services. For example, thousands of customers and partners are already using Google Cloud to capture the potential of AI, and we’ll share more there in a minute.\\n\\nAnd fourth, we are building and deploying AI responsibly, so that everyone can benefit. One area we are focused on is making sure people can more easily identify when they are encountering AI-generated content online. Using new technology powered by Google DeepMind SynthID, images generated by Vertex AI can be watermarked in a way that is invisible to the human eye, without reducing the image quality.\\n\\nUnderlying all this work is the foundational research done by our teams at Google DeepMind and Google Research. We are excited to roll out more of what they’ve been working on soon.\\n\\nAs we expand access to our new AI services, we continue to make meaningful investments in support of our AI efforts. We remain committed to durably re-engineering our cost base in order to help create capacity for these investments, in support of long-term, sustainable financial value. Across Alphabet, teams are looking at ways to operate as effectively as possible, focused on their biggest priorities.\\n\\nTurning next to YouTube, which saw solid momentum in both its ads and subscription businesses in Q3.\\n\\nNFL Sunday Ticket is now live and receiving excellent reviews. Fans love our multiview feature, which can livestream up to four games on a single screen. We have heard positive feedback from our partners at the NFL about the new features and livestream reliability. This is a clear example of our ability to execute big partnerships with excellence and at scale.\\n\\nI’m really pleased with the growth and engagement on YouTube Shorts. We continue to work on closing the monetization gap here. Shorts now average over 70 billion daily views and are watched by over 2 billion signed-in users every month.\\n\\nAt Made On YouTube in September, we announced new tools that make it easier to create engaging content. Dream Screen is an experimental feature that allows creators to add AI-generated video or image backgrounds to Shorts. And YouTube Create is a new mobile app with a suite of production tools for editing Shorts, longer videos or both.\\n\\nNext, Google Cloud. We see continued growth, with Q3 revenue of $8.4 billion, up 22%.\\n\\nToday, more than 60% of the world’s thousand-largest companies are Google Cloud customers. At Cloud Next, we showcased amazing innovations across our entire portfolio of Infrastructure, Data and AI, Workspace Collaboration, and Cybersecurity solutions.\\n\\nWe offer advanced AI-optimized infrastructure to train and serve models at scale, and today, more than half of all funded generative AI startups are Google Cloud customers. This includes AI21 Labs, Contextual, Elemental Cognition, Writer, and more.\\n\\nWe continue to provide the widest choice of accelerator options. Our A3 VMs powered by NVIDIA’s H100 GPU are generally available, and we are winning customers with Cloud TPU v5e, our most cost-efficient and versatile accelerator to date.\\n\\nOn top of our infrastructure, our Vertex AI platform helps customers build, deploy and scale AI-powered applications. We offer more than 100 models -- including popular third-party and open-source models, as well as tools to quickly build Search and Conversation use cases. From Q2 to Q3, the number of active generative AI projects on Vertex AI grew by 7X, including Highmark Health, which is creating more personalized member materials.\\n\\nDuet AI was created using Google’s leading large foundation models and is specially trained to help users to be more productive on Google Cloud. We continue expanding its capabilities and integrating it across a wide range of Cloud products and services.\\n\\nWith Duet AI, we’re helping leading brands like PayPal and Deutsche Bank boost developer productivity. And we are enabling retailers like Aritzia and Gymshark to gain new insights for better and faster business results. In fact, companies are increasingly using AI for the purpose of analyzing data, and customers are choosing Google Cloud because we are the only large cloud provider with a unified platform to analyze structured and unstructured data.\\n\\nIn Workspace, thousands of companies and more than a million trusted testers have used Duet AI. They are writing and refining content in Gmail and Docs, creating original images from text within Slides, organizing data in Sheets, and more. These innovations enable us to provide new services and grow our base of 10 million paying customers, including enterprises like Grupo Boticario, Unilever and Warner Music.\\n\\nWe also integrated Duet AI across our cybersecurity portfolio to differentiate in the marketplace, providing generative AI-powered assistance in Mandiant Threat Intelligence, Chronicle Security Operations and Security Command Center. This reduces the time security teams spend writing, running and refining searches by seven times. We are the only leading security provider that combines frontline intelligence and expertise, a modern security operations platform, and a trusted cloud foundation, all infused with generative AI -- helping protect customers and partners like BT, Jack Henry and Associates, and CoverMyMeds.\\n\\nTurning to hardware. We unveiled our new products this month. We introduced our new Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel Watch 2 to very positive consumer feedback and reviews. Pixel is the fastest-growing smartphone brand in our top markets, and the only one that grew in units sold year over year.\\n\\nOur portfolio of Pixel products are brought to life thanks to our combination of foundational technologies -- AI, Android and Google Tensor. Google Tensor G3 is the third generation of our tailor-built chip. It’s designed to power transformative experiences by bringing the latest in Google AI research directly to our newest phones.\\n\\nAnd new AI-powered editing features in Google Photos on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro remove distractions, generate the best shot from multiple images, and reduce distracting sounds in videos. Pixel and our third-party ecosystem are powered by Android. We just released Android 14 with more accessibility features.\\n\\nI also want to mention Chromebooks Plus, a new category which provides the best of Chrome on great hardware, with built-in Google apps and powerful AI capabilities. We also shared that Chromebooks will now get regular automatic updates for 10 years -- more than any other operating system.\\n\\nIn Other Bets, Waymo is onboarding more riders to its commercial ride-hailing service as it gradually adds over 100,000 people from its San Francisco waitlist. Austin will follow as its next ride-hail city.\\n\\nWing and Walmart announced a new partnership to provide drone delivery service in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\\n\\nBefore handing over to Philipp, I want to thank our employees around the world who are working to create innovative products and provide great services to people and businesses who use our products.\\n\\nPhilipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Thanks, Sundar. And hi, everyone.\\n\\nI’ll start with our performance for the quarter and then give color into the three key priority areas for Ads -- Google AI, Retail, and YouTube -- that we’ve identified on past calls as opportunities for long-term growth in advertising.\\n\\nGoogle Services revenues of $68 billion were up 11% year-on-year.\\n\\nIn Google Advertising, Search & Other, revenues grew 11% year-on-year, led by solid growth in the Retail vertical. In YouTube Ads, revenues were up 12% year-on-year, driven by growth in both brand and direct response. In Network, revenues declined 3% year-on-year.\\n\\nGoogle Other revenues were up 21% year-on-year, led by strong growth in YouTube subscription revenues.\\n\\nLet’s start with Google AI. Recent dramatic advances in everything from foundational research models, to LLMs, to generative AI are improving our ability to deliver better performance and profitability for advertisers and more helpful, delightful experiences for users.\\n\\nWe covered many innovations last quarter after GML, like our conversational experience in Google Ads, significant updates to Performance Max and new campaign types like Demand Gen. And as Sundar said, we’re continuing to experiment with new ad formats on SGE. It’s extremely important to us that in this new experience, advertisers still have the opportunity to reach potential customers along their search journeys. I’ll highlight more ways we’re innovating with the best of Google AI as we double-click into our core business.\\n\\nIn retail, we had a great quarter. In a market where every dollar counts, our proven AI-powered solutions like Search and PMax are helping retailers drive reliable, strong ROI and meet customers wherever they are across the funnel. In Q3, we also started prepping retailers for what will be a long holiday season.\\n\\nLet me share some themes.\\n\\nNumber one - With the maximum number of days between Thanksgiving and Christmas -- and expectations for many micro-peaks beyond Cyber 5 -- we’re arming businesses with insights and planning tools, including Optiscore and Performance Planner, to uncover new opportunities, plan budgets and targets to stay competitive, and be smarter with their inventory and pricing strategy.\\n\\nNumber two - Consumer expectations are shifting, especially around price and convenience. We’ve seen 4X “deals’’ queries during the holidays versus other periods. 75% of users say they’ll shop with those offering free shipping. Retailers are capitalizing on these trends with our differentiated merchant offerings like merchant promotions and fulfillment options, and we’re making improvements to significantly boost the number of deals shown to shoppers in Search this holiday season. Look out for more in the coming days about new ways we’ll help shoppers browse deals across the web this year.\\n\\nNumber three - No surprise, Omnichannel is the way to succeed. With our suite of omni-product solutions including Local Inventory Ads, omnibidding, and PMax for Store Goals, retailers big and small are capturing demand and incremental store budgets while engaging with high-value customers.\\n\\nInnovation continues across our shopping and merchant experiences, powered by Google AI. Our virtual try-on tool for apparel launched in June and has been a hit with consumers and brands. Users engage with virtual try-on images at a higher rate versus regular brand-provided images.\\n\\nProduct Studio is another launch from GML getting positive feedback in pilot mode. It uses the best of gen AI to help businesses create unique and tailored imagery for free that they can then scale across their channels. We’re seeing early merchant testers using it to “seasonalize” their content for the holidays.\\n\\nLet’s shift to YouTube. It’s worth repeating: our intense focus on creator success coupled with our multiformat strategy are at the center of how we think about YouTube’s long-term growth. Shorts, Connected TV and our subscription offerings are key drivers here, and we’re investing across each to solidify YouTube’s position as the best place to create, the best place to watch and the best place to deliver results.\\n\\nSundar mentioned watchtime and engagement momentum on Shorts as well as our monetization progress. He also covered subscription growth and NFL Sunday Ticket. As for Connected TV, we continue to be the number one overall streaming destination according to Nielsen. 150 million+ people are watching YouTube on CTV screens every month in the U.S.\\n\\nWhether it’s music videos, NFL Sunday Ticket, free movies, Shorts, a continuous stream of MrBeast or some other creator-led content, viewers want choice and variety and we’re giving it to them all in one place.\\n\\nAnd to help creators and advertisers connect with these billions of viewers across moments, screens and formats, we’re bringing Google AI to awesome new creation tools and ad solutions.\\n\\nAI will do wonders for creation and storytelling. From Dream Screen and YouTube Create -- which Sundar talked about -- to features that autodub content in multiple languages, flip and trim existing assets, remix and clip videos, and more, we’re just getting started.\\n\\nWe’re also helping brands break through at speed and scale across the funnel to drive results. Spotlight Moments launched last week. It uses AI to identify trending content around major cultural moments for brand sponsorship opportunities.\\n\\nThere’s Video Reach Campaigns, which are expanding to in-feed and Shorts and will be generally available in November. AI is helping advertisers find as many people as possible in their ideal audience for the lowest possible price. Early tests are delivering 54% more reach at 42% lower cost.\\n\\nAnd then with Video View campaigns, AI is serving skippable ads across in-stream, in-feed, and Shorts and helping advertisers earn the maximum number of views at the lowest possible cost. So far, they’re driving 40% more views, on average, versus in-stream alone.\\n\\nThen for YouTube and other feed-based surfaces, there’s our new Demand Gen campaign which launched in April, rolled out worldwide last week, and was designed for the needs of today’s social marketers to engage people as they stream, scroll and connect. It combines video and image ads in one campaign, with access to 3 billion users across YouTube and Google, and the ability to optimize and measure across the funnel using Google AI. Demand Gen is already driving success for brands like Samsung and Toyota.\\n\\nBefore I wrap, one quick highlight on our close collaboration and commitment to our most important ecosystems and partners.\\n\\nIn July, we launched Google News Showcase in the U.S., our curated online news experience and licensing program, with more than 150 news publications, 90% of which are local or regional. Globally, over 2,500 news publications have signed on to News Showcase, and the product is live in 23 countries to date. Our commitment to open access to news and information remains strong.\\n\\nWith that, I’ll end with a thank you to our customers and partners around the world for their continued trust and collaboration, and our Googlers everywhere for their incredible hard work and dedication.\\n\\nRuth, over to you.\\n\\nRuth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Philipp.\\n\\nWe are very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter, driven by meaningful growth in Search and YouTube, and momentum in Cloud.\\n\\nMy comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state otherwise.\\n\\nI will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook.\\n\\nFor the third quarter, our Consolidated Revenues were $76.7 billion, up 11% in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth.\\n\\nIn terms of expenses, Total Cost of Revenues was $33.2 billion, up 7%, primarily reflecting Other Cost of Revenues of $20.6 billion, which was up 6%.\\n\\nGrowth here was primarily driven by Content Acquisition Costs, mainly for YouTube subscription offerings.\\n\\nAs noted in our earnings release, the overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives we made starting in the first quarter of the year.\\n\\nOperating expenses were $22.1 billion, up 6%, reflecting the following: First, an increase in R&D expenses, driven primarily by compensation; second, an increase in G&A expenses reflecting the impact of charges related to legal matters; and finally, Sales & Marketing expenses, which were relatively flat to last year.\\n\\nOperating income was $21.3 billion, up 25%, and our operating margin was 28%.\\n\\nOther Income & Expense was a loss of $146 million.\\n\\nNet income was $19.7 billion. This reflects an effective tax rate of 7% in the third quarter from an IRS change related to the use of foreign tax credits which had an outsized impact on the third-quarter rate, because the change resulted in a catch-up for prior periods.\\n\\nWe delivered Free Cash Flow of $22.6 billion in the third quarter and $78 billion for the trailing 12 months.\\n\\nWe ended the quarter with $120 billion in cash and marketable securities. As a reminder, our cash balance and free cash flow in the second and third quarters benefited from the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter of 2023. As noted in our earnings release, on October 16 we made an estimated tax payment of $10.5 billion related to this deferral, which will be reflected in our cash balance and free cash flow in the fourth quarter.\\n\\nTurning to segment results, within Google Services, Revenues were $68 billion, up 11%.\\n\\nGoogle Search and Other advertising revenues of $44 billion in the quarter were up 11%, led again by growth in retail.\\n\\nYouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion, were up 12% driven by both brand advertising and direct response.\\n\\nNetwork advertising revenues of $7.7 billion were down 3%.\\n\\nOther Revenues were $8.3 billion, up 21%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues, driven by subscriber growth in YouTube TV, followed by YouTube Music Premium.\\n\\nGoogle Services Operating Income was $23.9 billion, up 27%, and the operating margin was 35%.\\n\\nTurning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $8.4 billion for the quarter, up 22%. GCP revenue growth remained strong across geographies, industries and products, although the Q3 year-on-year growth rate reflects the impact of customer optimization efforts. Google Workspace also delivered strong revenue growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had Operating Income of $266 million, and the operating margin was 3%.\\n\\nAs to our Other Bets, for the third quarter, revenues were $297 million and the operating loss was $1.2 billion.\\n\\nTurning to our outlook for the business, with respect to Google Services.\\n\\nFirst, within Advertising, after a period of historic volatility, we were pleased with the year-on-year revenue growth of Search and YouTube advertising in the third quarter.\\n\\nSecond, within Other Revenues, in our YouTube subscription products, the substantial growth in revenues primarily reflects subscriber growth.\\n\\nLooking ahead, a full quarter of NFL Sunday Ticket revenues, as well as associated content acquisition costs, will be reflected in Q4 results, compared to only a few weeks in the third quarter.\\n\\nPlay had solid growth in the third quarter, driven primarily by an increase in the number of buyers.\\n\\nWith respect to Hardware, there is a headwind to revenues in the fourth quarter, reflecting efforts to optimize the portfolio with tighter targeting of our go-to-market investments, as well as the ongoing impact from the difference in launch timing for the Pixel 6a and 7a that we mentioned last quarter.\\n\\nTurning to Google Cloud, we are pleased with the ongoing customer engagement with GCP and Workspace, and the potential benefit of our AI solutions -- including infrastructure and services such as VertexAI and Duet.\\n\\nWe continue to invest aggressively, given the significant potential we see, while remaining focused on profitable growth.\\n\\nIn terms of expenses and profitability, we’re pleased with our operating performance.\\n\\nAs we have repeatedly stressed, we remain focused on durably re-engineering our cost base to create investment capacity to support our growth priorities, most important of which is with AI. We have a number of workstreams in place:\\n\\nFirst, we are maintaining a slower pace of headcount growth, reflecting product prioritization and reallocation of talent to support our most important growth opportunities.\\n\\nSecond, we remain focused on optimizing our real estate footprint, including how and where we work, to reduce our expense growth. As you can see from our earnings release, we incurred $207 million in accelerated rent and depreciation in the third quarter related to these actions.\\n\\nThird, we have engineering workstreams underway to improve productivity across Alphabet. Given the magnitude of investment in our technical infrastructure, we have a superb team focused on efficiency of our operations there. We are also making progress in streamlining operations across Alphabet through the use of AI.\\n\\nFinally, there are ongoing workstreams that are improving the efficiency of our spend with suppliers and vendors through our central procurement organization.\\n\\nAnd to be clear, across the portfolio of Other Bets companies, we have also been working to identify opportunities to create sharper focus and to operate more efficiently and effectively.\\n\\nWith respect to sequential quarter-on-quarter trends, two further points: First, Cost of Sales in the fourth quarter will reflect both higher hardware costs given Pixel family launches, as well as increased CAC for YouTube as previously noted. Second, as usual, we expect Sales and Marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the end of the year in part to support product launches and the holiday season.\\n\\nFinally, our reported capex in Q3 was $8 billion, driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component for servers, followed by data centers, reflecting a meaningful increase in our investments in AI compute.\\n\\nThe growth in reported cash capex in Q3 is somewhat muted due to the timing of supplier payments, which can cause variability from quarter to quarter.\\n\\nWe continue to invest meaningfully in the technical infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see in AI across Alphabet and expect elevated levels of investment, increasing in the fourth quarter of 2023 and continuing to grow in 2024.\\n\\nIn closing, we remain very excited about the opportunities ahead and committed to deliver sustainable financial value.\\n\\nSundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions.\\n\\nAs a reminder, to ask a question you will need to press star *1 on your telephone. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been asked. And our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\\n\\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is somewhat of a jump ball. There is somewhat of an investor debate about the incremental return on capital to Search when it comes to AI. I know it’s early, but are there any examples that you’re seeing with SGE or Bard on higher utility, higher conversion rates, more engagement? Just something to sort of show signal around the return that could come from these investments?\\n\\nAnd the second one, Ruth, I know you have spoken a lot about durably re-engineering the cost base. I think in the past you talked about how expenses could grow slower than revenue in 2024. Is that sort of still the high-level way to think about it, or is that potentially changing a bit as investments are continuing? Thanks.\\n\\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Ruth, do you want to take the second part, I’ll take the first?\\n\\nRuth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: Sure. Thanks for that, Brian. Overall, that’s sort of a truism, as you know well, that looking to grow revenues at a faster rate than expenses as we’re focused on delivering sustainable financial value, and so that really takes us to the workstreams which I tried to tick through again. Those remain the driver. They’re the real priority. Those are the efforts that are going to enable us to keep expense growth as moderated as possible while supporting the investment growth that is so exciting in front of us, in particular around AI.\\n\\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: To your first part, obviously, we see AI as a foundational platform shift and are excited about the opportunities across our business. It starts with Search. I’ve been pretty pleased with how the user feedback has been on SGE. We are rolling it out to more users. Through it all, we’re making sure the product works well and we are generating value for our ecosystem and that Ads transitions well.\\n\\nI think I view this as, with AI, the opportunity to evolve Search and Assistant over the next decade ahead. And I think as we’ve always seen, when you continue to invest and build great experiences, you can get value on the other side.\\n\\nAnd I do think over time there will be newer paths, just like we’ve done on YouTube. I think with the AI work, there are subscription models as a possible path as well.\\n\\nObviously, all of the AI investments we’re doing applies across Cloud, too, and I’m pretty optimistic about what’s ahead there as well.\\n\\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great. Thank you, both.\\n\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\\n\\nDoug Anmuth (JPMorgan): Thanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar and one for Ruth.\\n\\nSundar, you talked a lot about AI. I was hoping you could talk more about Gemini and how it will differentiate from other models -- some of the multimodal capabilities and what new experiences or [agents] you think it could unlock and how we should think about timing.\\n\\nAnd then also just on Cloud, hoping you can talk about some of the factors there on the decel in Cloud and just what you’re seeing in terms of optimizations, and is there any sign of new workload deployments taking place? Thanks.\\n\\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thanks, good questions. So on Gemini, obviously, it’s an effort from our combined Google DeepMind team. I’m very excited at the progress there and as we’re working through getting the model ready.\\n\\nTo me, more importantly, we are just really laying the foundation of what I think of as the next-generation series of models we’ll be launching all throughout 2024. The pace of innovation is extraordinarily impressive to see. We are creating it from the ground up to be multimodal, highly efficient with tool and API integrations, and more importantly, laying the platform to enable future innovations as well.\\n\\nWe are developing Gemini in a way that it is going to be available at various sizes and capabilities, and we’ll be using it immediately across all our products internally as well as bringing it out to both developers and Cloud customers through Vertex.\\n\\nSo I view it as a journey, and each generation is going to be better than the other. And we are definitely investing, and the early results are very promising.\\n\\nOn Cloud, maybe what I would say is, overall, we have definitely started seeing customers looking to optimize spend. We leaned into it to help customers, given some of the challenges they were facing, and so that was a factor.\\n\\nBut we are definitely seeing a lot of interest in AI. There are many, many projects underway now. Just on Vertex alone, the number of projects grew over 7X. And so we see signs of stabilization, and I’m optimistic about what’s ahead.\\n\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\\n\\nEric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs): Thank you very much for taking the questions. Two, if I could.\\n\\nSundar, you guys led over a year ago starting with Performance Max, and I wanted to know if we could get your updated thoughts on how AI might impact the broader advertising industry and how you are aligning Alphabet and Google’s goals with AI and where it might take the advertising industry in the years ahead. That would be the first question.\\n\\nAnd then about a year ago, Philipp and Ruth started talking about some of the brand advertising headwinds that YouTube was facing. As we start to lap those headwinds, how should we be thinking about a broad recovery in brand advertising versus elements of still headwinds that are being faced in the broader Ads spaces, specifically with YouTube? Thank you.\\n\\nPhilipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: So maybe I take the first one.\\n\\nWe are very pleased with how Performance Max is performing. It gives advertisers really a maximum performance across all inventory from one really AI-powered campaign, and it’s probably the ultimate example of AI in action across our Ads products. It’s delivering excellent ROI. Those using it achieve on average over 18% more conversions at a similar cost per action.\\n\\nSince rolling it out about two years ago, we’ve continued to expand the features, give advertisers additional ways to steer how it works. We have a lot of things, like account-level negative keywords, other details here. We launched new lifecycle goals -- customer lifecycle goals, we called them. A revamped asset creation flow that really helps business adapt and scale their most successful creatives. I think that’s one to watch.\\n\\nWe will also continue to build other new PMax features based on all the advertiser feedback we’re seeing. So we are very, very encouraged by the progress here.\\n\\nOverall maybe -- there was a second part to your question, a bit on what we’re hearing from the customers out there. Look, driving ROI and efficiency is still top of mind for many, right? It’s a rapidly shifting and still quite unpredictable consumer landscape out there.\\n\\nOur AI tools are very well-received. AI, gen AI are top of mind for everybody really. There’s a ton of excitement, lots of questions about it. Many understand the value. Nearly 80% of our advertisers already use at least one AI-powered Search Ads product.\\n\\nYeah, we’re hearing a lot of good feedback on, number one, our Ads AI Essentials, which are really helping to unlock the power of AI and set up for durable ROI growth on the advertiser side. Those are products like the foundation for our data and measurement, things like Google Tag, Consent Mode and so on. Obviously Search and PMax, we talked about it, and then all those gen AI products, all those different ones. So there’s a whole lot of interest in those products.\\n\\nRuth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: Then on to your second question regarding YouTube. As we said, overall, year-on-year growth in revenues was driven by both brand advertising and direct response. But very much to your question, yes, there was a stabilization in spending by advertisers. We’re really pleased about that. We’re particularly pleased about the ongoing performance in the Living Room and on Shorts. And as I said, that’s both watchtime growth and monetization.\\n\\nI would say the other thing benefiting YouTube is the retail strength we talked about with Search -- retail strength in APAC in both Search and YouTube. That really began in the second quarter, continued in the third quarter, but that was another contributor. So quite a number of things going on. Feel good about the results the team was able to deliver here.\\n\\nEric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs): Thank you so much.\\n\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is open.\\n\\nLloyd Walmsley (UBS): Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two, if I can.\\n\\nFirst, as we just think about the rollout of SGE across the user base, how far along is that? And how do you balance the product rollout and consumer uptake versus monetization in that transition?\\n\\nAnd then the second one, also sort of generative AI-related, how quickly are you guys finding new ways of optimizing? Whether that’s shrinking model sizes, chip efficiencies or anything else. And do you think overall capital intensity of business scales up, or do you just find ways to do this more efficiently as usage scales? Anything you can share there would be great. Thanks.\\n\\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: The first part about SGE, we are still in very early days in terms of how much we have rolled it out. But we have definitely gotten it out to enough people, both geographically, across user segments and enough to know that the product is working well. It improves the experience.\\n\\nBut there are areas to improve, which we are fine-tuning. Our true north here is getting at the right user experience we want to, and I’m pretty comfortable seeing the trajectory. And we’ve always worked through these transitions, be it from desktop to mobile or from now, mobile to an AI-enhanced experience.\\n\\nSo it’s nothing new, and I feel very comfortable that as we go through it, the strength of our teams -- both on the organic side as well as Ads side -- to drive the right experience for users including Ads will pay dividends. I think we’ll continue to make improvements and make progress there.\\n\\nOn your second question, at a high level, I would say all through the -- we just celebrated 25 years -- and of all the things I was proud about, when I looked at the strength of the work we’ve done across our infrastructure as a company, our technical infrastructure as a company, and various given stages at a given moment in time, when we adopted new generations of technology. We’ve looked at the cost of it, but then the curves, the efficiency curves we have driven on top of it, has always been phenomenal to see. And I see the current moment as no different. Already through this year, we are driving significant efficiencies, both in our models, in training costs and serving costs, and our ability to adapt what’s needed to the right use case.\\n\\nAnd so I think we’ll do everything that is needed to make sure we have the leading AI models and infrastructure in the world, bar none. And we will continue driving efficiencies from there.\\n\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\\n\\nMichael Nathanson (Moffett): Thank you. I’m going to ask you guys a multi-part question on YouTube TV. So, firstly, what were the broader objectives for getting Sunday Ticket? How did it perform versus those objectives? What lessons have you learned from having NFL Sunday Ticket? How does that affect your appetite for more sports going forward? Thanks.\\n\\nPhilipp Schindler: So, as Sundar said earlier, we are several weeks into our first season and we are very pleased with how it’s going. I think in the broader context, you have to look at it as our overall YouTube subscription strategy.\\n\\nThe great feedback we’ve gotten so far on the YouTube experience is very, very significant. People love the navigation and they love multiview. They love the chats and the polls. And frankly, people are very happy with the lack of latency here.\\n\\nThe number one piece of concrete feedback the team has gotten is actually that people want the ability to pick their own games for multiview, which is -- multiview is the awesome feature we started rolling out on YouTube TV that gives fans the ability to basically watch multiple streams here at once. And, yeah, overall, the teams are working hard to build a fantastic experience, and we are really trying to stay focused on getting our first season right and providing the best possible experience really for fans here.\\n\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\\n\\nJustin Post (Bank of America): Great. Thank you, a couple questions on Q4. Can you provide any color on if there’s been any pause in advertising around the Middle East conflict in October? Anything we should be aware of for Q4?\\n\\nAnd then second, when we do think about the Sunday Ticket impact, I know you can’t give us revenues or expenses, but overall, would that be a headwind to margins in Q4 or something we should be thinking about? Thank you.\\n\\nRuth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: So look, on the first question, obviously this is a tragic, tragic -- there are no words to talk about what’s going on. And all of our focus has been on supporting our people there and how our products can be as helpful as possible in this very painful time, broadly. And so nothing really to add.\\n\\nAnd then in terms of the second question, Sunday Ticket, the only thing I tried to call out there is that clearly this is the first full quarter of Sunday Ticket that is contributing overall to the subscription revenues that we see. That’s in part of Other Revenues. Also obviously, it is contributing to higher CAC in the fourth quarter. So tried to make that really clear.\\n\\nAnd as we look longer term, we expect to generate an attractive return over the life of the deal. We’re continuing to invest in support of this. And excited about the additional opportunities that come out of it working with partners to deliver clips and other opportunities.\\n\\nAs we’ve said, we’ve heard positive feedback from our partners at the NFL about the new features and livestream reliability. And this is really a clear example of our ability to execute big partnerships with excellence at scale and really leverage a lot of the extraordinary magic at YouTube and across Google. And that’s what we’re excited about.\\n\\nJustin Post (Bank of America): Great, thank you.\\n\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\\n\\nKen Gawrelski (Wells Fargo): Thank you so much. Two questions, if I may.\\n\\nFirst, how do you think about the future structure of AI-driven Search capabilities? Will activity remain centralized in a search bar, or will it be decentralized and present in many different applications, including on third-party applications? You alluded to Bard being integrated into multiple Google experiences earlier in the call.\\n\\nAnd then the second question is, any update on the Chrome cookie deprecation planned to begin in 1Q ’24? What have you seen so far based on your early testing of Privacy Sandbox, and what advertiser feedback have you received?\\n\\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: On your first question, look, you know, I broadly think of it as people are looking for information. They’ve always looked for it in many, many different ways. We’ve given the product search example. People can directly go to Amazon, as an example, or come to Google.\\n\\nIf you zoom back and take an information view of the world, there’s always been many different ways to get it. And part of our work we do in making Search be world-class and give users what they’re looking for is so that we can get at as much of that intent as possible.\\n\\nSo I don’t see that changing. With mobile, there were more ways that people could get information, but we worked hard to make Search work better in the mobile world. And similarly, I view with AI, there will be many ways people get information. But it also offers us an opportunity in Search and in Assistant to take it to the next level and answer use cases, which we couldn’t have done before, and expand a diverse set of needs where we are a source. So that’s how I see the opportunity ahead.\\n\\nPhilipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: And to the second part of your question: yes, Chrome still plans to begin phasing out third-party cookies in the second half of ’24.\\n\\nIn the last several months, Chrome has really made significant progress on the Privacy Sandbox with APIs for developer testing. And they are now generally available in Chrome.\\n\\nOur Ads team is testing these APIs. And as we shared back in April, the preliminary results of our interest-based ads testing showed a combination of what we call privacy-preserving signals and AI optimization actually provides positive results for businesses preparing for a cookieless future.\\n\\nWe also recently announced that in Q1 of ’24 we plan to deprecate third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users, and this will support developers, obviously, in conducting their real-world experiments to assess the readiness and effectiveness of their products without third-party cookies.\\n\\nAnd we’re overall encouraged by the ecosystem engagement on Privacy Sandbox. We’ll continue to work with the industry and regulators in how these technologies can support the transition to, frankly, a more private web.\\n\\nOperator: And our last question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is now open.\\n\\nMark Mahaney (Evercore ISI): Thank you. Two questions, please.\\n\\nRuth, you talked about these elevated levels of investments in Q4 and in ’24. I’m sorry, were you referring to just CapEx or CapEx and total expenses?\\n\\nAnd then on the comments around stabilization in Cloud, is this something that you just started to see in the September quarter, or had you seen that starting earlier in the year? And if you just started seeing it in the September quarter, would you have any thoughts on why you would have seen it, why Google Cloud would have seen it maybe later than some of the other hyperscalers? Thank you.\\n\\nRuth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: So I think what you’re referring to was my CapEx comment. I was trying to make the point that we are committed to meaningfully investing in CapEx, given all the opportunities we see.\\n\\nWe do continue to expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. It will be increasing in the fourth quarter. And talked about some of the difference in timing, muted timing in the third quarter due to the timing of supplier payments.\\n\\nAnd then tried to make it clear that we will continue to grow CapEx in 2024 -- or more specifically to your question, 2024 aggregate CapEx will be above the full year 2023. So that was the main one.\\n\\nAnd then as it relates to Cloud, as Sundar said, what we’re really excited about is the revenue growth does reflect healthy customer adoption across the portfolio, and that’s Infrastructure, Data Analytics, it’s Security. And so I can’t comment on others, but we feel good about where we’re sitting here and looking forward. And we’ll let you do the forecasting.\\n\\nGCP growth in the third quarter was above the growth rate for Cloud overall, and we feel really good about the work that they’re doing there. And then, of course, in addition to that is all of the contribution from Google Workspace.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.\\n\\nJim Friedland, Director Investor Relations: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter 2023 call. Thank you and have a good evening.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.'"

are in listen-only mode.\\nAfter the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.\\nTo ask a question during the session, you will need to press *1 on your telephone.\\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations.\\nPlease go ahead.\\n\\nGood afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet’s Third Quarter 2023 Earnings conference call.\\nWith us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat.\\nNow I’ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor.\\n\\nSome of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking.\\nSuch statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.\\n\\nActual results could differ materially.\\nPlease refer to our Form 10-K, including our risk factor section and our Form 10-Qs.\\nWe undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\\n\\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.\\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.\\n\\nOur comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise.\\nAnd now I’ll turn the call over to Sundar.\\n\\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Jim.\\nAnd hello, everyone.\\n\\nI’m pleased with our business results this quarter, which demonstrate strong growth in Search and YouTube, and momentum in Cloud.\\n\\nGoogle turned 25 in September, which offered an opportunity to reflect on our progress over the last quarter century, and to look ahead to the opportunities enabled by AI we are so excited and confident about.\\n\\nOur product momentum continued this quarter, as you saw with Cloud Next, Made on YouTube and Made by Google.\\nIt’s all part of our focus on making AI more helpful for everyone, and we are making good progress across the four areas that we shared last quarter.\\n\\nFirst, improving knowledge and learning.\\nThis includes our work with the Search Generative Experience, which is our experiment to bring generative AI capabilities into Search.\\n\\nWe’ve learned a lot from people trying it, and we’ve added new capabilities, like incorporating videos and images into responses and generating imagery.\\nWe’ve also made it easier to understand and debug generated code.\\n\\nDirect user feedback has been positive, with strong growth in adoption.\\n\\nIn August, we opened up availability to India and Japan, with more countries and languages to come.\\n\\nAs we add features and expand into new markets, we’re engaging with the broader ecosystem and will continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users, send valuable traffic to publishers, and support a healthy, open Internet.\\n\\nWith generative AI applied to Search, we can serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives.\\n\\nWe are surfacing more links with SGE, and linking to a wider range of sources on the results page, creating new opportunities for content to be discovered.\\n\\nOf course, ads will continue to play an important role in this new Search experience.\\nPeople are finding ads helpful here, as they provide useful options to take action and connect with businesses.\\n\\nWe’ll experiment with new formats native to SGE that use generative AI to create relevant, high-quality ads, customized to every step of the search journey.\\n\\nThe second area we are focused on is boosting creativity and productivity.\\nBard is particularly helpful here; it’s a direct interface to a conversational LLM, and we think of it as an early experiment and complementary experience to Google Search.\\n\\nBard can now integrate with Google apps and services, showing relevant information from Workspace, Maps, YouTube, and Google Flights and hotels.\\n\\nWe’ve also improved the “Google it” feature.\\nIt provides other sources to help people evaluate Bard’s responses and explore information across the web.\\n\\nEarlier this month, we announced Assistant with Bard -- a personal assistant powered by generative AI.\\nIt combines Bard’s generative and reasoning capabilities with Assistant’s personalized help.\\nYou can interact with it through text, voice or images, and in the coming months, you’ll be able to opt in on Android and iOS mobile devices.\\n\\nOur collaborative tools in Workspace and YouTube are also part of how we boost creativity and productivity, and they are seeing great initial traction.\\n\\nThird, we are enabling developers, businesses and other organizations to build their own transformative products and services.\\nFor example, thousands of customers and partners are already using Google Cloud to capture the potential of AI, and we’ll share more there in a minute.\\n\\nAnd fourth, we are building and deploying AI responsibly, so that everyone can benefit.\\nOne area we are focused on is making sure people can more easily identify when they are encountering AI-generated content online.\\nUsing new technology powered by Google DeepMind SynthID, images generated by Vertex AI can be watermarked in a way that is invisible to the human eye, without reducing the image quality.\\n\\nUnderlying all this work is the foundational research done by our teams at Google DeepMind and Google Research.\\nWe are excited to roll out more of what they’ve been working on soon.\\n\\nAs we expand access to our new AI services, we continue to make meaningful investments in support of our AI efforts.\\nWe remain committed to durably re-engineering our cost base in order to help create capacity for these investments, in support of long-term, sustainable financial value.\\nAcross Alphabet, teams are looking at ways to operate as effectively as possible, focused on their biggest priorities.\\n\\nTurning next to YouTube, which saw solid momentum in both its ads and subscription businesses in Q3.\\n\\nNFL Sunday Ticket is now live and receiving excellent reviews.\\nFans love our multiview feature, which can livestream up to four games on a single screen.\\nWe have heard positive feedback from our partners at the NFL about the new features and livestream reliability.\\nThis is a clear example of our ability to execute big partnerships with excellence and at scale.\\n\\nI’m really pleased with the growth and engagement on YouTube Shorts.\\nWe continue to work on closing the monetization gap here.\\nShorts now average over 70 billion daily views and are watched by over 2 billion signed-in users every month.\\n\\nAt Made On YouTube in September, we announced new tools that make it easier to create engaging content.\\nDream Screen is an experimental feature that allows creators to add AI-generated video or image backgrounds to Shorts.\\nAnd YouTube Create is a new mobile app with a suite of production tools for editing Shorts, longer videos or both.\\n\\nNext, Google Cloud.\\nWe see continued growth, with Q3 revenue of $8.4 billion, up 22%.\\n\\nToday, more than 60% of the world’s thousand-largest companies are Google Cloud customers.\\nAt Cloud Next, we showcased amazing innovations across our entire portfolio of Infrastructure, Data and AI, Workspace Collaboration, and Cybersecurity solutions.\\n\\nWe offer advanced AI-optimized infrastructure to train and serve models at scale, and today, more than half of all funded generative AI startups are Google Cloud customers.\\nThis includes AI21 Labs, Contextual, Elemental Cognition, Writer, and more.\\n\\nWe continue to provide the widest choice of accelerator options.\\nOur A3 VMs powered by NVIDIA’s H100 GPU are generally available, and we are winning customers with Cloud TPU v5e, our most cost-efficient and versatile accelerator to date.\\n\\nOn top of our infrastructure, our Vertex AI platform helps customers build, deploy and scale AI-powered applications.\\nWe offer more than 100 models -- including popular third-party and open-source models, as well as tools to quickly build Search and Conversation use cases.\\nFrom Q2 to Q3, the number of active generative AI projects on Vertex AI grew by 7X, including Highmark Health, which is creating more personalized member materials.\\n\\nDuet AI was created using Google’s leading large foundation models and is specially trained to help users to be more productive on Google Cloud.\\nWe continue expanding its capabilities and integrating it across a wide range of Cloud products and services.\\n\\nWith Duet AI, we’re helping leading brands like PayPal and Deutsche Bank boost developer productivity.\\nAnd we are enabling retailers like Aritzia and Gymshark to gain new insights for better and faster business results.\\nIn fact, companies are increasingly using AI for the purpose of analyzing data, and customers are choosing Google Cloud because we are the only large cloud provider with a unified platform to analyze structured and unstructured data.\\n\\nIn Workspace, thousands of companies and more than a million trusted testers have used Duet AI.\\nThey are writing and refining content in Gmail and Docs, creating original images from text within Slides, organizing data in Sheets, and more.\\nThese innovations enable us to provide new services and grow our base of 10 million paying customers, including enterprises like Grupo Boticario, Unilever and Warner Music.\\n\\nWe also integrated Duet AI across our cybersecurity portfolio to differentiate in the marketplace, providing generative AI-powered assistance in Mandiant Threat Intelligence, Chronicle Security Operations and Security Command Center.\\nThis reduces the time security teams spend writing, running and refining searches by seven times.\\nWe are the only leading security provider that combines frontline intelligence and expertise, a modern security operations platform, and a trusted cloud foundation, all infused with generative AI -- helping protect customers and partners like BT, Jack Henry and Associates, and CoverMyMeds.\\n\\nTurning to hardware.\\nWe unveiled our new products this month.\\nWe introduced our new Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel Watch 2 to very positive consumer feedback and reviews.\\nPixel is the fastest-growing smartphone brand in our top markets, and the only one that grew in units sold year over year.\\n\\nOur portfolio of Pixel products are brought to life thanks to our combination of foundational technologies -- AI, Android and Google Tensor.\\nGoogle Tensor G3 is the third generation of our tailor-built chip.\\nIt’s designed to power transformative experiences by bringing the latest in Google AI research directly to our newest phones.\\n\\nAnd new AI-powered editing features in Google Photos on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro remove distractions, generate the best shot from multiple images, and reduce distracting sounds in videos.\\nPixel and our third-party ecosystem are powered by Android.\\nWe just released Android 14 with more accessibility features.\\n\\nI also want to mention Chromebooks Plus, a new category which provides the best of Chrome on great hardware, with built-in Google apps and powerful AI capabilities.\\nWe also shared that Chromebooks will now get regular automatic updates for 10 years -- more than any other operating system.\\n\\nIn Other Bets, Waymo is onboarding more riders to its commercial ride-hailing service as it gradually adds over 100,000 people from its San Francisco waitlist.\\nAustin will follow as its next ride-hail city.\\n\\nWing and Walmart announced a new partnership to provide drone delivery service in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\\n\\nBefore handing over to Philipp, I want to thank our employees around the world who are working to create innovative products and provide great services to people and businesses who use our products.\\n\\nPhilipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Thanks, Sundar.\\nAnd hi, everyone.\\n\\nI’ll start with our performance for the quarter and then give color into the three key priority areas for Ads -- Google AI, Retail, and YouTube -- that we’ve identified on past calls as opportunities for long-term growth in advertising.\\n\\nGoogle Services revenues of $68 billion were up 11% year-on-year.\\n\\nIn Google Advertising, Search & Other, revenues grew 11% year-on-year, led by solid growth in the Retail vertical.\\nIn YouTube Ads, revenues were up 12% year-on-year, driven by growth in both brand and direct response.\\nIn Network, revenues declined 3% year-on-year.\\n\\nGoogle Other revenues were up 21% year-on-year, led by strong growth in YouTube subscription revenues.\\n\\nLet’s start with Google AI.\\nRecent dramatic advances in everything from foundational research models, to LLMs, to generative AI are improving our ability to deliver better performance and profitability for advertisers and more helpful, delightful experiences for users.\\n\\nWe covered many innovations last quarter after GML, like our conversational experience in Google Ads, significant updates to Performance Max and new campaign types like Demand Gen.\\nAnd as Sundar said, we’re continuing to experiment with new ad formats on SGE.\\nIt’s extremely important to us that in this new experience, advertisers still have the opportunity to reach potential customers along their search journeys.\\nI’ll highlight more ways we’re innovating with the best of Google AI as we double-click into our core business.\\n\\nIn retail, we had a great quarter.\\nIn a market where every dollar counts, our proven AI-powered solutions like Search and PMax are helping retailers drive reliable, strong ROI and meet customers wherever they are across the funnel.\\nIn Q3, we also started prepping retailers for what will be a long holiday season.\\n\\nLet me share some themes.\\n\\nNumber one - With the maximum number of days between Thanksgiving and Christmas -- and expectations for many micro-peaks beyond Cyber 5 -- we’re arming businesses with insights and planning tools, including Optiscore and Performance Planner, to uncover new opportunities, plan budgets and targets to stay competitive, and be smarter with their inventory and pricing strategy.\\n\\nNumber two - Consumer expectations are shifting, especially around price and convenience.\\nWe’ve seen 4X “deals’’ queries during the holidays versus other periods.\\n75% of users say they’ll shop with those offering free shipping.\\nRetailers are capitalizing on these trends with our differentiated merchant offerings like merchant promotions and fulfillment options, and we’re making improvements to significantly boost the number of deals shown to shoppers in Search this holiday season.\\nLook out for more in the coming days about new ways we’ll help shoppers browse deals across the web this year.\\n\\nNumber three - No surprise, Omnichannel is the way to succeed.\\nWith our suite of omni-product solutions including Local Inventory Ads, omnibidding, and PMax for Store Goals, retailers big and small are capturing demand and incremental store budgets while engaging with high-value customers.\\n\\nInnovation continues across our shopping and merchant experiences, powered by Google AI.\\nOur virtual try-on tool for apparel launched in June and has been a hit with consumers and brands.\\nUsers engage with virtual try-on images at a higher rate versus regular brand-provided images.\\n\\nProduct Studio is another launch from GML getting positive feedback in pilot mode.\\nIt uses the best of gen AI to help businesses create unique and tailored imagery for free that they can then scale across their channels.\\nWe’re seeing early merchant testers using it to “seasonalize” their content for the holidays.\\n\\nLet’s shift to YouTube.\\nIt’s worth repeating: our intense focus on creator success coupled with our multiformat strategy are at the center of how we think about YouTube’s long-term growth.\\nShorts, Connected TV and our subscription offerings are key drivers here, and we’re investing across each to solidify YouTube’s position as the best place to create, the best place to watch and the best place to deliver results.\\n\\nSundar mentioned watchtime and engagement momentum on Shorts as well as our monetization progress.\\nHe also covered subscription growth and NFL Sunday Ticket.\\nAs for Connected TV, we continue to be the number one overall streaming destination according to Nielsen.\\n150 million+ people are watching YouTube on CTV screens every month in the U.S.\\n\\nWhether it’s music videos, NFL Sunday Ticket, free movies, Shorts, a continuous stream of MrBeast or some other creator-led content, viewers want choice and variety and we’re giving it to them all in one place.\\n\\nAnd to help creators and advertisers connect with these billions of viewers across moments, screens and formats, we’re bringing Google AI to awesome new creation tools and ad solutions.\\n\\nAI will do wonders for creation and storytelling.\\nFrom Dream Screen and YouTube Create -- which Sundar talked about -- to features that autodub content in multiple languages, flip and trim existing assets, remix and clip videos, and more, we’re just getting started.\\n\\nWe’re also helping brands break through at speed and scale across the funnel to drive results.\\nSpotlight Moments launched last week.\\nIt uses AI to identify trending content around major cultural moments for brand sponsorship opportunities.\\n\\nThere’s Video Reach Campaigns, which are expanding to in-feed and Shorts and will be generally available in November.\\nAI is helping advertisers find as many people as possible in their ideal audience for the lowest possible price.\\nEarly tests are delivering 54% more reach at 42% lower cost.\\n\\nAnd then with Video View campaigns, AI is serving skippable ads across in-stream, in-feed, and Shorts and helping advertisers earn the maximum number of views at the lowest possible cost.\\nSo far, they’re driving 40% more views, on average, versus in-stream alone.\\n\\nThen for YouTube and other feed-based surfaces, there’s our new Demand Gen campaign which launched in April, rolled out worldwide last week, and was designed for the needs of today’s social marketers to engage people as they stream, scroll and connect.\\nIt combines video and image ads in one campaign, with access to 3 billion users across YouTube and Google, and the ability to optimize and measure across the funnel using Google AI.\\nDemand Gen is already driving success for brands like Samsung and Toyota.\\n\\nBefore I wrap, one quick highlight on our close collaboration and commitment to our most important ecosystems and partners.\\n\\nIn July, we launched Google News Showcase in the U.S., our curated online news experience and licensing program, with more than 150 news publications, 90% of which are local or regional.\\nGlobally, over 2,500 news publications have signed on to News Showcase, and the product is live in 23 countries to date.\\nOur commitment to open access to news and information remains strong.\\n\\nWith that, I’ll end with a thank you to our customers and partners around the world for their continued trust and collaboration, and our Googlers everywhere for their incredible hard work and dedication.\\n\\nRuth, over to you.\\n\\nRuth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Philipp.\\n\\nWe are very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter, driven by meaningful growth in Search and YouTube, and momentum in Cloud.\\n\\nMy comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state otherwise.\\n\\nI will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook.\\n\\nFor the third quarter, our Consolidated Revenues were $76.7 billion, up 11% in both reported and constant currency.\\nSearch remained the largest contributor to revenue growth.\\n\\nIn terms of expenses, Total Cost of Revenues was $33.2 billion, up 7%, primarily reflecting Other Cost of Revenues of $20.6 billion, which was up 6%.\\n\\nGrowth here was primarily driven by Content Acquisition Costs, mainly for YouTube subscription offerings.\\n\\nAs noted in our earnings release, the overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives we made starting in the first quarter of the year.\\n\\nOperating expenses were $22.1 billion, up 6%, reflecting the following: First, an increase in R&D expenses, driven primarily by compensation; second, an increase in G&A expenses reflecting the impact of charges related to legal matters; and finally, Sales & Marketing expenses, which were relatively flat to last year.\\n\\nOperating income was $21.3 billion, up 25%, and our operating margin was 28%.\\n\\nOther Income & Expense was a loss of $146 million.\\n\\nNet income was $19.7 billion.\\nThis reflects an effective tax rate of 7% in the third quarter from an IRS change related to the use of foreign tax credits which had an outsized impact on the third-quarter rate, because the change resulted in a catch-up for prior periods.\\n\\nWe delivered Free Cash Flow of $22.6 billion in the third quarter and $78 billion for the trailing 12 months.\\n\\nWe ended the quarter with $120 billion in cash and marketable securities.\\nAs a reminder, our cash balance and free cash flow in the second and third quarters benefited from the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter of 2023.\\nAs noted in our earnings release, on October 16 we made an estimated tax payment of $10.5 billion related to this deferral, which will be reflected in our cash balance and free cash flow in the fourth quarter.\\n\\nTurning to segment results, within Google Services, Revenues were $68 billion, up 11%.\\n\\nGoogle Search and Other advertising revenues of $44 billion in the quarter were up 11%, led again by growth in retail.\\n\\nYouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion, were up 12% driven by both brand advertising and direct response.\\n\\nNetwork advertising revenues of $7.7 billion were down 3%.\\n\\nOther Revenues were $8.3 billion, up 21%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues, driven by subscriber growth in YouTube TV, followed by YouTube Music Premium.\\n\\nGoogle Services Operating Income was $23.9 billion, up 27%, and the operating margin was 35%.\\n\\nTurning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $8.4 billion for the quarter, up 22%.\\nGCP revenue growth remained strong across geographies, industries and products, although the Q3 year-on-year growth rate reflects the impact of customer optimization efforts.\\nGoogle Workspace also delivered strong revenue growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat.\\nGoogle Cloud had Operating Income of $266 million, and the operating margin was 3%.\\n\\nAs to our Other Bets, for the third quarter, revenues were $297 million and the operating loss was $1.2 billion.\\n\\nTurning to our outlook for the business, with respect to Google Services.\\n\\nFirst, within Advertising, after a period of historic volatility, we were pleased with the year-on-year revenue growth of Search and YouTube advertising in the third quarter.\\n\\nSecond, within Other Revenues, in our YouTube subscription products, the substantial growth in revenues primarily reflects subscriber growth.\\n\\nLooking ahead, a full quarter of NFL Sunday Ticket revenues, as well as associated content acquisition costs, will be reflected in Q4 results, compared to only a few weeks in the third quarter.\\n\\nPlay had solid growth in the third quarter, driven primarily by an increase in the number of buyers.\\n\\nWith respect to Hardware, there is a headwind to revenues in the fourth quarter, reflecting efforts to optimize the portfolio with tighter targeting of our go-to-market investments, as well as the ongoing impact from the difference in launch timing for the Pixel 6a and 7a that we mentioned last quarter.\\n\\nTurning to Google Cloud, we are pleased with the ongoing customer engagement with GCP and Workspace, and the potential benefit of our AI solutions -- including infrastructure and services such as VertexAI and Duet.\\n\\nWe continue to invest aggressively, given the significant potential we see, while remaining focused on profitable growth.\\n\\nIn terms of expenses and profitability, we’re pleased with our operating performance.\\n\\nAs we have repeatedly stressed, we remain focused on durably re-engineering our cost base to create investment capacity to support our growth priorities, most important of which is with AI.\\nWe have a number of workstreams in place:\\n\\nFirst, we are maintaining a slower pace of headcount growth, reflecting product prioritization and reallocation of talent to support our most important growth opportunities.\\n\\nSecond, we remain focused on optimizing our real estate footprint, including how and where we work, to reduce our expense growth.\\nAs you can see from our earnings release, we incurred $207 million in accelerated rent and depreciation in the third quarter related to these actions.\\n\\nThird, we have engineering workstreams underway to improve productivity across Alphabet.\\nGiven the magnitude of investment in our technical infrastructure, we have a superb team focused on efficiency of our operations there.\\nWe are also making progress in streamlining operations across Alphabet through the use of AI.\\n\\nFinally, there are ongoing workstreams that are improving the efficiency of our spend with suppliers and vendors through our central procurement organization.\\n\\nAnd to be clear, across the portfolio of Other Bets companies, we have also been working to identify opportunities to create sharper focus and to operate more efficiently and effectively.\\n\\nWith respect to sequential quarter-on-quarter trends, two further points: First, Cost of Sales in the fourth quarter will reflect both higher hardware costs given Pixel family launches, as well as increased CAC for YouTube as previously noted.\\nSecond, as usual, we expect Sales and Marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the end of the year in part to support product launches and the holiday season.\\n\\nFinally, our reported capex in Q3 was $8 billion, driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component for servers, followed by data centers, reflecting a meaningful increase in our investments in AI compute.\\n\\nThe growth in reported cash capex in Q3 is somewhat muted due to the timing of supplier payments, which can cause variability from quarter to quarter.\\n\\nWe continue to invest meaningfully in the technical infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see in AI across Alphabet and expect elevated levels of investment, increasing in the fourth quarter of 2023 and continuing to grow in 2024.\\n\\nIn closing, we remain very excited about the opportunities ahead and committed to deliver sustainable financial value.\\n\\nSundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions.\\n\\nAs a reminder, to ask a question you will need to press star *1 on your telephone.\\nTo prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been asked.\\nAnd our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\\nYour line is open.\\n\\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great.\\nThanks for taking my questions.\\nI have two.\\nThe first one is somewhat of a jump ball.\\nThere is somewhat of an investor debate about the incremental return on capital to Search when it comes to AI.\\nI know it’s early, but are there any examples that you’re seeing with SGE or Bard on higher utility, higher conversion rates, more engagement? Just something to sort of show signal around the return that could come from these investments?\\n\\nAnd the second one, Ruth, I know you have spoken a lot about durably re-engineering the cost base.\\nI think in the past you talked about how expenses could grow slower than revenue in 2024.\\nIs that sort of still the high-level way to think about it, or is that potentially changing a bit as investments are continuing? Thanks.\\n\\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Ruth, do you want to take the second part, I’ll take the first?\\n\\nRuth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: Sure.\\nThanks for that, Brian.\\nOverall, that’s sort of a truism, as you know well, that looking to grow revenues at a faster rate than expenses as we’re focused on delivering sustainable financial value, and so that really takes us to the workstreams which I tried to tick through again.\\nThose remain the driver.\\nThey’re the real priority.\\nThose are the efforts that are going to enable us to keep expense growth as moderated as possible while supporting the investment growth that is so exciting in front of us, in particular around AI.\\n\\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: To your first part, obviously, we see AI as a foundational platform shift and are excited about the opportunities across our business.\\nIt starts with Search.\\nI’ve been pretty pleased with how the user feedback has been on SGE.\\nWe are rolling it out to more users.\\nThrough it all, we’re making sure the product works well and we are generating value for our ecosystem and that Ads transitions well.\\n\\nI think I view this as, with AI, the opportunity to evolve Search and Assistant over the next decade ahead.\\nAnd I think as we’ve always seen, when you continue to invest and build great experiences, you can get value on the other side.\\n\\nAnd I do think over time there will be newer paths, just like we’ve done on YouTube.\\nI think with the AI work, there are subscription models as a possible path as well.\\n\\nObviously, all of the AI investments we’re doing applies across Cloud, too, and I’m pretty optimistic about what’s ahead there as well.\\n\\nBrian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great.\\nThank you, both.\\n\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\\nYour line is open.\\n\\nDoug Anmuth (JPMorgan): Thanks for taking the questions.\\nOne for Sundar and one for Ruth.\\n\\nSundar, you talked a lot about AI.\\nI was hoping you could talk more about Gemini and how it will differentiate from other models -- some of the multimodal capabilities and what new experiences or [agents] you think it could unlock and how we should think about timing.\\n\\nAnd then also just on Cloud, hoping you can talk about some of the factors there on the decel in Cloud and just what you’re seeing in terms of optimizations, and is there any sign of new workload deployments taking place? Thanks.\\n\\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thanks, good questions.\\nSo on Gemini, obviously, it’s an effort from our combined Google DeepMind team.\\nI’m very excited at the progress there and as we’re working through getting the model ready.\\n\\nTo me, more importantly, we are just really laying the foundation of what I think of as the next-generation series of models we’ll be launching all throughout 2024.\\nThe pace of innovation is extraordinarily impressive to see.\\nWe are creating it from the ground up to be multimodal, highly efficient with tool and API integrations, and more importantly, laying the platform to enable future innovations as well.\\n\\nWe are developing Gemini in a way that it is going to be available at various sizes and capabilities, and we’ll be using it immediately across all our products internally as well as bringing it out to both developers and Cloud customers through Vertex.\\n\\nSo I view it as a journey, and each generation is going to be better than the other.\\nAnd we are definitely investing, and the early results are very promising.\\n\\nOn Cloud, maybe what I would say is, overall, we have definitely started seeing customers looking to optimize spend.\\nWe leaned into it to help customers, given some of the challenges they were facing, and so that was a factor.\\n\\nBut we are definitely seeing a lot of interest in AI.\\nThere are many, many projects underway now.\\nJust on Vertex alone, the number of projects grew over 7X.\\nAnd so we see signs of stabilization, and I’m optimistic about what’s ahead.\\n\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\\nYour line is now open.\\n\\nEric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs): Thank you very much for taking the questions.\\nTwo, if I could.\\n\\nSundar, you guys led over a year ago starting with Performance Max, and I wanted to know if we could get your updated thoughts on how AI might impact the broader advertising industry and how you are aligning Alphabet and Google’s goals with AI and where it might take the advertising industry in the years ahead.\\nThat would be the first question.\\n\\nAnd then about a year ago, Philipp and Ruth started talking about some of the brand advertising headwinds that YouTube was facing.\\nAs we start to lap those headwinds, how should we be thinking about a broad recovery in brand advertising versus elements of still headwinds that are being faced in the broader Ads spaces, specifically with YouTube? Thank you.\\n\\nPhilipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: So maybe I take the first one.\\n\\nWe are very pleased with how Performance Max is performing.\\nIt gives advertisers really a maximum performance across all inventory from one really AI-powered campaign, and it’s probably the ultimate example of AI in action across our Ads products.\\nIt’s delivering excellent ROI.\\nThose using it achieve on average over 18% more conversions at a similar cost per action.\\n\\nSince rolling it out about two years ago, we’ve continued to expand the features, give advertisers additional ways to steer how it works.\\nWe have a lot of things, like account-level negative keywords, other details here.\\nWe launched new lifecycle goals -- customer lifecycle goals, we called them.\\nA revamped asset creation flow that really helps business adapt and scale their most successful creatives.\\nI think that’s one to watch.\\n\\nWe will also continue to build other new PMax features based on all the advertiser feedback we’re seeing.\\nSo we are very, very encouraged by the progress here.\\n\\nOverall maybe -- there was a second part to your question, a bit on what we’re hearing from the customers out there.\\nLook, driving ROI and efficiency is still top of mind for many, right? It’s a rapidly shifting and still quite unpredictable consumer landscape out there.\\n\\nOur AI tools are very well-received.\\nAI, gen AI are top of mind for everybody really.\\nThere’s a ton of excitement, lots of questions about it.\\nMany understand the value.\\nNearly 80% of our advertisers already use at least one AI-powered Search Ads product.\\n\\nYeah, we’re hearing a lot of good feedback on, number one, our Ads AI Essentials, which are really helping to unlock the power of AI and set up for durable ROI growth on the advertiser side.\\nThose are products like the foundation for our data and measurement, things like Google Tag, Consent Mode and so on.\\nObviously Search and PMax, we talked about it, and then all those gen AI products, all those different ones.\\nSo there’s a whole lot of interest in those products.\\n\\nRuth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: Then on to your second question regarding YouTube.\\nAs we said, overall, year-on-year growth in revenues was driven by both brand advertising and direct response.\\nBut very much to your question, yes, there was a stabilization in spending by advertisers.\\nWe’re really pleased about that.\\nWe’re particularly pleased about the ongoing performance in the Living Room and on Shorts.\\nAnd as I said, that’s both watchtime growth and monetization.\\n\\nI would say the other thing benefiting YouTube is the retail strength we talked about with Search -- retail strength in APAC in both Search and YouTube.\\nThat really began in the second quarter, continued in the third quarter, but that was another contributor.\\nSo quite a number of things going on.\\nFeel good about the results the team was able to deliver here.\\n\\nEric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs): Thank you so much.\\n\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS.\\nYour line is open.\\n\\nLloyd Walmsley (UBS): Great.\\nThanks for taking the question.\\nTwo, if I can.\\n\\nFirst, as we just think about the rollout of SGE across the user base, how far along is that? And how do you balance the product rollout and consumer uptake versus monetization in that transition?\\n\\nAnd then the second one, also sort of generative AI-related, how quickly are you guys finding new ways of optimizing? Whether that’s shrinking model sizes, chip efficiencies or anything else.\\nAnd do you think overall capital intensity of business scales up, or do you just find ways to do this more efficiently as usage scales? Anything you can share there would be great.\\nThanks.\\n\\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: The first part about SGE, we are still in very early days in terms of how much we have rolled it out.\\nBut we have definitely gotten it out to enough people, both geographically, across user segments and enough to know that the product is working well.\\nIt improves the experience.\\n\\nBut there are areas to improve, which we are fine-tuning.\\nOur true north here is getting at the right user experience we want to, and I’m pretty comfortable seeing the trajectory.\\nAnd we’ve always worked through these transitions, be it from desktop to mobile or from now, mobile to an AI-enhanced experience.\\n\\nSo it’s nothing new, and I feel very comfortable that as we go through it, the strength of our teams -- both on the organic side as well as Ads side -- to drive the right experience for users including Ads will pay dividends.\\nI think we’ll continue to make improvements and make progress there.\\n\\nOn your second question, at a high level, I would say all through the -- we just celebrated 25 years -- and of all the things I was proud about, when I looked at the strength of the work we’ve done across our infrastructure as a company, our technical infrastructure as a company, and various given stages at a given moment in time, when we adopted new generations of technology.\\nWe’ve looked at the cost of it, but then the curves, the efficiency curves we have driven on top of it, has always been phenomenal to see.\\nAnd I see the current moment as no different.\\nAlready through this year, we are driving significant efficiencies, both in our models, in training costs and serving costs, and our ability to adapt what’s needed to the right use case.\\n\\nAnd so I think we’ll do everything that is needed to make sure we have the leading AI models and infrastructure in the world, bar none.\\nAnd we will continue driving efficiencies from there.\\n\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.\\nYour line is now open.\\n\\nMichael Nathanson (Moffett): Thank you.\\nI’m going to ask you guys a multi-part question on YouTube TV.\\nSo, firstly, what were the broader objectives for getting Sunday Ticket? How did it perform versus those objectives? What lessons have you learned from having NFL Sunday Ticket? How does that affect your appetite for more sports going forward? Thanks.\\n\\nPhilipp Schindler: So, as Sundar said earlier, we are several weeks into our first season and we are very pleased with how it’s going.\\nI think in the broader context, you have to look at it as our overall YouTube subscription strategy.\\n\\nThe great feedback we’ve gotten so far on the YouTube experience is very, very significant.\\nPeople love the navigation and they love multiview.\\nThey love the chats and the polls.\\nAnd frankly, people are very happy with the lack of latency here.\\n\\nThe number one piece of concrete feedback the team has gotten is actually that people want the ability to pick their own games for multiview, which is -- multiview is the awesome feature we started rolling out on YouTube TV that gives fans the ability to basically watch multiple streams here at once.\\nAnd, yeah, overall, the teams are working hard to build a fantastic experience, and we are really trying to stay focused on getting our first season right and providing the best possible experience really for fans here.\\n\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America.\\nYour line is now open.\\n\\nJustin Post (Bank of America): Great.\\nThank you, a couple questions on Q4.\\nCan you provide any color on if there’s been any pause in advertising around the Middle East conflict in October? Anything we should be aware of for Q4?\\n\\nAnd then second, when we do think about the Sunday Ticket impact, I know you can’t give us revenues or expenses, but overall, would that be a headwind to margins in Q4 or something we should be thinking about? Thank you.\\n\\nRuth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: So look, on the first question, obviously this is a tragic, tragic -- there are no words to talk about what’s going on.\\nAnd all of our focus has been on supporting our people there and how our products can be as helpful as possible in this very painful time, broadly.\\nAnd so nothing really to add.\\n\\nAnd then in terms of the second question, Sunday Ticket, the only thing I tried to call out there is that clearly this is the first full quarter of Sunday Ticket that is contributing overall to the subscription revenues that we see.\\nThat’s in part of Other Revenues.\\nAlso obviously, it is contributing to higher CAC in the fourth quarter.\\nSo tried to make that really clear.\\n\\nAnd as we look longer term, we expect to generate an attractive return over the life of the deal.\\nWe’re continuing to invest in support of this.\\nAnd excited about the additional opportunities that come out of it working with partners to deliver clips and other opportunities.\\n\\nAs we’ve said, we’ve heard positive feedback from our partners at the NFL about the new features and livestream reliability.\\nAnd this is really a clear example of our ability to execute big partnerships with excellence at scale and really leverage a lot of the extraordinary magic at YouTube and across Google.\\nAnd that’s what we’re excited about.\\n\\nJustin Post (Bank of America): Great, thank you.\\n\\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo.\\nYour line is now open.\\n\\nKen Gawrelski (Wells Fargo): Thank you so much.\\nTwo questions, if I may.\\n\\nFirst, how do you think about the future structure of AI-driven Search capabilities? Will activity remain centralized in a search bar, or will it be decentralized and present in many different applications, including on third-party applications? You alluded to Bard being integrated into multiple Google experiences earlier in the call.\\n\\nAnd then the second question is, any update on the Chrome cookie deprecation planned to begin in 1Q ’24? What have you seen so far based on your early testing of Privacy Sandbox, and what advertiser feedback have you received?\\n\\nSundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: On your first question, look, you know, I broadly think of it as people are looking for information.\\nThey’ve always looked for it in many, many different ways.\\nWe’ve given the product search example.\\nPeople can directly go to Amazon, as an example, or come to Google.\\n\\nIf you zoom back and take an information view of the world, there’s always been many different ways to get it.\\nAnd part of our work we do in making Search be world-class and give users what they’re looking for is so that we can get at as much of that intent as possible.\\n\\nSo I don’t see that changing.\\nWith mobile, there were more ways that people could get information, but we worked hard to make Search work better in the mobile world.\\nAnd similarly, I view with AI, there will be many ways people get information.\\nBut it also offers us an opportunity in Search and in Assistant to take it to the next level and answer use cases, which we couldn’t have done before, and expand a diverse set of needs where we are a source.\\nSo that’s how I see the opportunity ahead.\\n\\nPhilipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: And to the second part of your question: yes, Chrome still plans to begin phasing out third-party cookies in the second half of ’24.\\n\\nIn the last several months, Chrome has really made significant progress on the Privacy Sandbox with APIs for developer testing.\\nAnd they are now generally available in Chrome.\\n\\nOur Ads team is testing these APIs.\\nAnd as we shared back in April, the preliminary results of our interest-based ads testing showed a combination of what we call privacy-preserving signals and AI optimization actually provides positive results for businesses preparing for a cookieless future.\\n\\nWe also recently announced that in Q1 of ’24 we plan to deprecate third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users, and this will support developers, obviously, in conducting their real-world experiments to assess the readiness and effectiveness of their products without third-party cookies.\\n\\nAnd we’re overall encouraged by the ecosystem engagement on Privacy Sandbox.\\nWe’ll continue to work with the industry and regulators in how these technologies can support the transition to, frankly, a more private web.\\n\\nOperator: And our last question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore.\\nYour line is now open.\\n\\nMark Mahaney (Evercore ISI): Thank you.\\nTwo questions, please.\\n\\nRuth, you talked about these elevated levels of investments in Q4 and in ’24.\\nI’m sorry, were you referring to just CapEx or CapEx and total expenses?\\n\\nAnd then on the comments around stabilization in Cloud, is this something that you just started to see in the September quarter, or had you seen that starting earlier in the year? And if you just started seeing it in the September quarter, would you have any thoughts on why you would have seen it, why Google Cloud would have seen it maybe later than some of the other hyperscalers? Thank you.\\n\\nRuth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: So I think what you’re referring to was my CapEx comment.\\nI was trying to make the point that we are committed to meaningfully investing in CapEx, given all the opportunities we see.\\n\\nWe do continue to expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure.\\nIt will be increasing in the fourth quarter.\\nAnd talked about some of the difference in timing, muted timing in the third quarter due to the timing of supplier payments.\\n\\nAnd then tried to make it clear that we will continue to grow CapEx in 2024 -- or more specifically to your question, 2024 aggregate CapEx will be above the full year 2023.\\nSo that was the main one.\\n\\nAnd then as it relates to Cloud, as Sundar said, what we’re really excited about is the revenue growth does reflect healthy customer adoption across the portfolio, and that’s Infrastructure, Data Analytics, it’s Security.\\nAnd so I can’t comment on others, but we feel good about where we’re sitting here and looking forward.\\nAnd we’ll let you do the forecasting.\\n\\nGCP growth in the third quarter was above the growth rate for Cloud overall, and we feel really good about the work that they’re doing there.\\nAnd then, of course, in addition to that is all of the contribution from Google Workspace.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you.\\nAnd that concludes our question-and-answer session for today.\\nI’d like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.\\n\\nJim Friedland, Director Investor Relations: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today.\\nWe look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter 2023 call.\\nThank you and have a good evening.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you, everyone.\\nThis concludes today’s conference call.\\nThank you for participating.\\nYou may now disconnect.'"

hello everyone im pleased with our business results this quarter which demonstrate strong growth in search and youtube and momentum in cloud google turned 25 in september which offered an opportunity to reflect on our progress over the last quarter century and to look ahead to the opportunities enabled by ai we are so excited and confident about our product momentum continued this quarter as you saw with cloud next made on youtube and made by google its all part of our focus on making ai more helpful for everyone and we are making good progress across the four areas that we shared last quarter first improving knowledge and learning this includes our work with the search generative experience which is our experiment to bring generative ai capabilities into search weve learned a lot from people trying it and weve added new capabilities like incorporating videos and images into responses and generating imagery weve also made it easier to understand and debug generated code direct user feedback has been positive with strong growth in adoption in august we opened up availability to india and japan with more countries and languages to come as we add features and expand into new markets were engaging with the broader ecosystem and will continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users send valuable traffic to publishers and support a healthy open internet with generative ai applied to search we can serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions including those that benefit from multiple perspectives we are surfacing more links with sge and linking to a wider range of sources on the results page creating new opportunities for content to be discovered of course ads will continue to play an important role in this new search experience people are finding ads helpful here as they provide useful options to take action and connect with businesses well experiment with new formats native to sge that use generative ai to create relevant highquality ads customized to every step of the search journey the second area we are focused on is boosting creativity and productivity bard is particularly helpful here its a direct interface to a conversational llm and we think of it as an early experiment and complementary experience to google search bard can now integrate with google apps and services showing relevant information from workspace maps youtube and google flights and hotels weve also improved the google it feature it provides other sources to help people evaluate bards responses and explore information across the web earlier this month we announced assistant with bard a personal assistant powered by generative ai it combines bards generative and reasoning capabilities with assistants personalized help you can interact with it through text voice or images and in the coming months youll be able to opt in on android and ios mobile devices our collaborative tools in workspace and youtube are also part of how we boost creativity and productivity and they are seeing great initial traction third we are enabling developers businesses and other organizations to build their own transformative products and services for example thousands of customers and partners are already using google cloud to capture the potential of ai and well share more there in a minute and fourth we are building and deploying ai responsibly so that everyone can benefit one area we are focused on is making sure people can more easily identify when they are encountering aigenerated content online using new technology powered by google deepmind synthid images generated by vertex ai can be watermarked in a way that is invisible to the human eye without reducing the image quality underlying all this work is the foundational research done by our teams at google deepmind and google research we are excited to roll out more of what theyve been working on soon as we expand access to our new ai services we continue to make meaningful investments in support of our ai efforts we remain committed to durably reengineering our cost base in order to help create capacity for these investments in support of longterm sustainable financial value across alphabet teams are looking at ways to operate as effectively as possible focused on their biggest priorities turning next to youtube which saw solid momentum in both its ads and subscription businesses in q3 nfl sunday ticket is now live and receiving excellent reviews fans love our multiview feature which can livestream up to four games on a single screen we have heard positive feedback from our partners at the nfl about the new features and livestream reliability this is a clear example of our ability to execute big partnerships with

color into the three key priority areas for ads google ai retail and youtube that weve identified on past calls as opportunities for longterm growth in advertising google services revenues of 68 billion were up 11 yearonyear in google advertising search other revenues grew 11 yearonyear led by solid growth in the retail vertical in youtube ads revenues were up 12 yearonyear driven by growth in both brand and direct response in network revenues declined 3 yearonyear google other revenues were up 21 yearonyear led by strong growth in youtube subscription revenues lets start with google ai recent dramatic advances in everything from foundational research models to llms to generative ai are improving our ability to deliver better performance and profitability for advertisers and more helpful delightful experiences for users we covered many innovations last quarter after gml like our conversational experience in google ads significant updates to performance max and new campaign types like demand gen and as sundar said were continuing to experiment with new ad formats on sge its extremely important to us that in this new experience advertisers still have the opportunity to reach potential customers along their search journeys ill highlight more ways were innovating with the best of google ai as we doubleclick into our core business in retail we had a great quarter in a market where every dollar counts our proven aipowered solutions like search and pmax are helping retailers drive reliable strong roi and meet customers wherever they are across the funnel in q3 we also started prepping retailers for what will be a long holiday season let me share some themes number one with the maximum number of days between thanksgiving and christmas and expectations for many micropeaks beyond cyber 5 were arming businesses with insights and planning tools including optiscore and performance planner to uncover new opportunities plan budgets and targets to stay competitive and be smarter with their inventory and pricing strategy number two consumer expectations are shifting especially around price and convenience weve seen 4x deals queries during the holidays versus other periods 75 of users say theyll shop with those offering free shipping retailers are capitalizing on these trends with our differentiated merchant offerings like merchant promotions and fulfillment options and were making improvements to significantly boost the number of deals shown to shoppers in search this holiday season look out for more in the coming days about new ways well help shoppers browse deals across the web this year number three no surprise omnichannel is the way to succeed with our suite of omniproduct solutions including local inventory ads omnibidding and pmax for store goals retailers big and small are capturing demand and incremental store budgets while engaging with highvalue customers innovation continues across our shopping and merchant experiences powered by google ai our virtual tryon tool for apparel launched in june and has been a hit with consumers and brands users engage with virtual tryon images at a higher rate versus regular brandprovided images product studio is another launch from gml getting positive feedback in pilot mode it uses the best of gen ai to help businesses create unique and tailored imagery for free that they can then scale across their channels were seeing early merchant testers using it to seasonalize their content for the holidays lets shift to youtube its worth repeating our intense focus on

investing across each to solidify youtubes position as the best place to create the best place to watch and the best place to deliver results sundar mentioned watchtime and engagement momentum on shorts as well as our monetization progress he also covered subscription growth and nfl sunday ticket as for connected tv we continue to be the number one overall streaming destination according to

product is live in 23 countries to date our commitment to open access to news and information remains strong with that ill end with a thank you to our customers and partners around the world for their continued trust and collaboration and our googlers everywhere for their incredible hard work and dedication ruth over to you ruth porat president and chief investment officer cfo alphabet and google thank you philipp we are very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter driven by meaningful growth in search and youtube and momentum in cloud my comments will be on yearoveryear comparisons for the third quarter unless i state otherwise i will start with results at the alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook for the third quarter our consolidated revenues were 767 billion up 11 in both reported and constant currency search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth in terms of expenses total cost of revenues was 332 billion up 7 primarily reflecting other cost of revenues of 206 billion which was up 6 growth here was primarily driven by content acquisition costs mainly for youtube subscription offerings as noted in our earnings release the overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives we made starting in the first quarter of the year operating expenses were 221 billion up 6 reflecting the following first an increase in rd expenses driven primarily by compensation second an increase in ga expenses reflecting the impact of charges related to legal matters and finally sales marketing expenses which were relatively flat to last year operating income was 213 billion up 25 and our operating margin was 28 other income expense was a loss of 146 million net income was 197 billion this reflects an effective tax rate of 7 in the third quarter from an irs change related to the use of foreign tax credits which had an outsized impact on the thirdquarter rate because the change resulted in a catchup for prior periods we delivered free cash flow of 226 billion in the third quarter and 78 billion for the trailing 12 months we ended the quarter with 120 billion in cash and marketable securities as a reminder our cash balance and free cash flow in the second and third quarters benefited from the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter of 2023 as noted in our earnings release on october 16 we made an estimated tax payment of 105 billion related to this deferral which will be reflected in our cash balance and free cash flow in the fourth quarter turning to segment results within google services revenues were 68 billion up 11 google search and other advertising revenues of 44 billion in the quarter were up 11 led again by growth in retail youtube advertising revenues of 8 billion were up 12 driven by both brand advertising and direct response network advertising revenues of 77 billion were down 3 other revenues were 83 billion up 21 primarily reflecting growth in youtube nonadvertising revenues driven by subscriber growth in youtube tv followed by youtube music premium google services operating income was 239 billion up 27 and the operating margin was 35 turning to the google cloud segment revenues were 84 billion for the quarter up 22 gcp revenue growth remained strong across geographies industries and products although the q3 yearonyear growth rate reflects the impact of customer optimization efforts google workspace also delivered strong revenue growth primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat google cloud had operating income of 266 million and the operating margin was 3 as to our other bets for the third quarter revenues were 297 million and the operating loss was 12 billion turning to our outlook for the business with respect to google services first within advertising after a period of historic volatility we were pleased with the yearonyear revenue growth of search and youtube advertising in the third quarter second within other revenues in our youtube subscription products the substantial growth in revenues primarily reflects subscriber growth looking ahead a full quarter of nfl sunday ticket revenues as well as associated content acquisition costs will be reflected in q4 results compared to only a few weeks in the third quarter play had solid growth in the third quarter driven primarily by an increase in the number of buyers with respect to hardware there is a headwind to revenues in the fourth quarter reflecting efforts to optimize the portfolio with tighter targeting of our gotomarket investments as well as the ongoing impact from the difference in launch timing for the pixel 6a and 7a that we mentioned last quarter turning to google cloud we are pleased with the ongoing customer engagement with gcp and workspace and the potential benefit of our ai solutions including infrastructure and services such as vertexai and duet we continue to invest aggressively given the significant potential we see while remaining focused on profitable growth in terms of expenses and profitability were pleased with our operating performance as we have repeatedly stressed we remain focused on durably reengineering our cost base to create investment capacity to support our growth priorities most important of which is with ai we have a number of workstreams in place first we are maintaining a slower pace of headcount growth reflecting product prioritization and reallocation of talent to support our most important growth opportunities second we remain focused on optimizing our real estate footprint including how and where we work to reduce our expense growth as you can see from our earnings release we incurred 207 million in accelerated rent and depreciation in the third quarter related to these actions third we have engineering workstreams underway to improve productivity across alphabet given the magnitude of investment in our technical infrastructure we have a superb team focused on efficiency of our operations there we are also making progress in streamlining operations across alphabet through the use of ai finally there are ongoing workstreams that are improving the efficiency of our spend with suppliers and vendors through our central procurement organization and to be clear across the portfolio of other bets companies we have also been working to identify opportunities to create sharper focus and to operate more efficiently and effectively with respect to sequential quarteronquarter trends two further points first cost of sales in the fourth quarter will reflect both higher hardware costs given pixel family launches as well as increased cac for youtube as previously noted second as usual we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the end of the year in part to support product launches and the holiday season finally our reported capex in q3 was 8 billion driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers reflecting a meaningful increase in our investments in ai compute the growth in reported cash capex in q3 is somewhat muted due to the timing of supplier payments which can cause variability from quarter to quarter we continue to invest meaningfully in the technical infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see in ai across alphabet and expect elevated levels of investment increasing in the fourth quarter of 2023 and continuing to grow in 2024 in closing we remain very excited about the opportunities ahead and committed to deliver sustainable financial value sundar philipp and i will now take your questions as a reminder to ask a question you will need to press star 1 on your telephone to prevent any background noise we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been asked and our first question comes from brian nowak with morgan stanley your line is open brian nowak morgan stanley great thanks for taking my questions i have two the first one is somewhat of a jump ball there is somewhat of an investor debate about the incremental return on capital to search when it comes to ai i know its early but are there any examples that youre seeing with sge or bard on higher utility higher conversion rates more engagement just something to sort of show signal around the return that could come from these investments and the second one ruth i know you have spoken a lot about durably reengineering the cost base i think in the past you talked about how expenses could grow slower than revenue in 2024 is that sort of still the highlevel way to think about it or is that potentially changing a bit as investments are continuing thanks sundar pichai ceo alphabet and google ruth do you want to take the second part ill take the first ruth porat president and chief investment officer cfo alphabet and google sure thanks for that brian overall thats sort of a truism as you know well that looking to grow revenues at a faster rate than expenses as were focused on delivering sustainable financial value and so that really takes us to the workstreams which i tried to tick through again those remain the driver theyre the real priority those are the efforts that are going to enable us to keep expense growth as moderated as possible while supporting the investment growth that is so exciting in front of us in particular around ai sundar pichai ceo alphabet and google to your first part obviously we see ai as a foundational platform shift and are excited about the opportunities across our business it starts with search ive been pretty pleased with how the user feedback has been on sge we are rolling it out to more users through it all were making sure the product works well and we are generating value for our ecosystem and that ads transitions well i think i view this as with ai the opportunity to evolve search and assistant over the next decade ahead and i think as weve always seen when you continue to invest and build great experiences you can get value on the other side and i do think over time there will be newer paths just like weve done on youtube i think with the ai work there are subscription models as a possible path as well obviously all of the ai investments were doing applies across cloud too and im pretty optimistic about whats ahead there as well brian nowak morgan stanley great thank you both operator your next question comes from doug anmuth with jpmorgan your line is open doug anmuth jpmorgan thanks for taking the questions one for sundar and one for ruth sundar you talked a lot about ai i was hoping you could talk more about gemini and how it will differentiate from other models some of the multimodal capabilities and what new experiences or agents you think it could unlock and how we should think about timing and then also just on cloud hoping you can talk about some of the factors there on the decel in cloud and just what youre seeing in terms of optimizations and is there any sign of new workload deployments taking place thanks sundar pichai ceo alphabet and google thanks good questions so on gemini obviously its an effort from our combined google deepmind team im very excited at the progress there and as were working through getting the model ready to me more importantly we are just really laying the foundation of what i think of as the nextgeneration series of models well be launching all throughout 2024 the pace of innovation is extraordinarily impressive to see we are creating it from the ground up to be multimodal highly efficient with tool and api integrations and more importantly laying the platform to enable future innovations as well we are developing gemini in a way that it is going to be available at various sizes and capabilities and well be using it immediately across all our products internally as well as bringing it out to both developers and cloud customers through vertex so i view it as a journey and each generation is going to be better than the other and we are definitely investing and the early results are very promising on cloud maybe what i would say is overall we have definitely started seeing customers looking to optimize spend we leaned into it to help customers given some of the challenges they were facing and so that was a factor but we are definitely seeing a lot of interest in ai there are many many projects underway now just on vertex alone the number of projects grew over 7x and so we see signs of stabilization and im optimistic about whats ahead operator your next question comes from eric sheridan with goldman sachs your line is now open eric sheridan goldman sachs thank you very much for taking the questions two if i could sundar you guys led over a year ago starting with performance max and i wanted to know if we could get your updated thoughts on how ai might impact the broader advertising industry and how you are aligning alphabet and googles goals with ai and where it might take the advertising industry in the years ahead that would be the first question and then about a year ago philipp and ruth started talking about some of the brand advertising headwinds that youtube was facing as we start to lap those headwinds how should we be thinking about a broad recovery in brand advertising versus elements of still headwinds that are being faced in the broader ads spaces specifically with youtube thank you philipp schindler svp and cbo google so maybe i take the first one we are very pleased with how performance max is performing it gives advertisers really a maximum performance across all inventory from one really aipowered campaign and its probably the ultimate example of ai in action across our ads products its delivering excellent roi those using it achieve on average over 18 more conversions at a similar cost per action since rolling it out about two years ago weve continued to expand the features give advertisers additional ways to steer how it works we have a lot of things like accountlevel negative keywords other details here we launched new lifecycle goals customer lifecycle goals we called them a revamped asset creation flow that really helps business adapt and scale their most successful creatives i think thats one to watch we will also continue to build other new pmax features based on all the advertiser feedback were seeing so we are very very encouraged by the progress here overall maybe there was a second part to your question a bit on what were hearing from the customers out there look driving roi and efficiency is still top of mind for many right its a rapidly shifting and still quite unpredictable consumer landscape out there our ai tools are very wellreceived ai gen ai are top of mind for everybody really theres a ton of excitement lots of questions about it many understand the value nearly 80 of our advertisers already use at least one aipowered search ads product yeah were hearing a lot of good feedback on number one our ads ai essentials which are really helping to unlock the power of ai and set up for durable roi growth on the advertiser side those are products like the foundation for our data and measurement things like google tag consent mode and so on obviously search and pmax we talked about it and then all those gen ai products all those different ones so theres a whole lot of interest in those products ruth porat president and chief investment officer cfo alphabet and google then on to your second question regarding youtube as we said overall yearonyear growth in revenues was driven by both brand advertising and direct response but very much to your question yes there was a stabilization in spending by advertisers were really pleased about that were particularly pleased about the ongoing performance in the living room and on shorts and as i said thats both watchtime growth and monetization i would say the other thing benefiting youtube is the retail strength we talked about with search retail strength in apac in both search and youtube that really began in the second quarter continued in the third quarter but that was another contributor so quite a number of things going on feel good about the results the team was able to deliver here eric sheridan goldman sachs thank you so much operator your next question comes from lloyd walmsley with ubs your line is open lloyd walmsley ubs great thanks for taking the question two if i can first as we just think about the rollout of sge across the user base how far along is that and how do you balance the product rollout and consumer uptake versus monetization in that transition and then the second one also sort of generative airelated how quickly are you guys finding new ways of optimizing whether thats shrinking model sizes chip efficiencies or anything else and do you think overall capital intensity of business scales up or do you just find ways to do this more efficiently as usage scales anything you can share there would be great thanks sundar pichai ceo alphabet and google the first part about sge we are still in very early days in terms of how much we have rolled it out but we have definitely gotten it out to enough people both geographically across user segments and enough to know that the product is working well it improves the experience but there are areas to improve which we are finetuning our true north here is getting at the right user experience we want to and im pretty comfortable seeing the trajectory and weve always worked through these transitions be it from desktop to mobile or from now mobile to an aienhanced experience so its nothing new and i feel very comfortable that as we go through it the strength of our teams both on the organic side as well as ads side to drive the right experience for users including ads will pay dividends i think well continue to make improvements and make progress there on your second question at a high level i would say all through the we just celebrated 25 years and of all the things i was proud about when i looked at the strength of the work weve done across our infrastructure as a company our technical infrastructure as a company and various given stages at a given moment in time when we adopted new generations of technology weve looked at the cost of it but then the curves the efficiency curves we have driven on top of it has always been phenomenal to see and i see the current moment as no different already through this year we are driving significant efficiencies both in our models in training costs and serving costs and our ability to adapt whats needed to the right use case and so i think well do everything that is needed to make sure we have the leading ai models and infrastructure in the world bar none and we will continue driving efficiencies from there operator your next question comes from michael nathanson with moffettnathanson your line is now open michael nathanson moffett thank you im going to ask you guys a multipart question on youtube tv so firstly what were the broader objectives for getting sunday ticket how did it perform versus those objectives what lessons have you learned from having nfl sunday ticket how does that affect your appetite for more sports going forward thanks philipp schindler so as sundar said earlier we are several weeks into our first season and we are very pleased with how its going i think in the broader context you have to look at it as our overall youtube subscription strategy the great feedback weve gotten so far on the youtube experience is very very significant people love the navigation and they love multiview they love the chats and the polls and frankly people are very happy with the lack of latency here the number one piece of concrete feedback the team has gotten is actually that people want the ability to pick their own games for multiview which is multiview is the awesome feature we started rolling out on youtube tv that gives fans the ability to basically watch multiple streams here at once and yeah overall the teams are working hard to build a fantastic experience and we are really trying to stay focused on getting our first season right and providing the best possible experience really for fans here operator your next question comes from justin post with bank of america your line is now open justin post bank of america great thank you a couple questions on q4 can you provide any color on if theres been any pause in advertising around the middle east conflict in october anything we should be aware of for q4 and then second when we do think about the sunday ticket impact i know you cant give us revenues or expenses but overall would that be a headwind to margins in q4 or something we should be thinking about thank you ruth porat president and chief investment officer cfo alphabet and google so look on the first question obviously this is a tragic tragic there are no words to talk about whats going on and all of our focus has been on supporting our people there and how our products can be as helpful as possible in this very painful time broadly and so nothing really to add and then in terms of the second question sunday ticket the only thing i tried to call out there is that clearly this is the first full quarter of sunday ticket that is contributing overall to the subscription revenues that we see thats in part of other revenues also obviously it is contributing to higher cac in the fourth quarter so tried to make that really clear and as we look longer term we expect to generate an attractive return over the life of the deal were continuing to invest in support of this and excited about the additional opportunities that come out of it working with partners to deliver clips and other opportunities as weve said weve heard positive feedback from our partners at the nfl about the new features and livestream reliability and this is really a clear example of our ability to execute big partnerships with excellence at scale and really leverage a lot of the extraordinary magic at youtube and across google and thats what were excited about justin post bank of america great thank you operator your next question comes from ken gawrelski with wells fargo your line is now open ken gawrelski wells fargo thank you so much two questions if i may first how do you think about the future structure of aidriven search capabilities will activity remain centralized in a search bar or will it be decentralized and present in many different applications including on thirdparty applications you alluded to bard being integrated into multiple google experiences earlier in the call and then the second question is any update on the chrome cookie deprecation planned to begin in 1q 24 what have you seen so far based on your early testing of privacy sandbox and what advertiser feedback have you received sundar pichai ceo alphabet and google on your first question look you know i broadly think of it as people are looking for information theyve always looked for it in many many different ways weve given the product search example people can directly go to amazon as an example or come to google if you zoom back and take an information view of the world theres always been many different ways to get it and part of our work we do in making search be worldclass and give users what theyre looking for is so that we can get at as much of that intent as possible so i dont see that changing with mobile there were more ways that people could get information but we worked hard to make search work better in the mobile world and similarly i view with ai there will be many ways people get information but it also offers us an opportunity in search and in assistant to take it to the next level and answer use cases which we couldnt have done before and expand a diverse set of needs where we are a source so thats how i see the opportunity ahead philipp schindler svp and cbo google and to the second part of your question yes chrome still plans to begin phasing out thirdparty cookies in the second half of 24 in the last several months chrome has really made significant progress on the privacy sandbox with apis for developer testing and they are now generally available in chrome our ads team is testing these apis and as we shared back in april the preliminary results of our interestbased ads testing showed a combination of what we call privacypreserving signals and ai optimization actually provides positive results for businesses preparing for a cookieless future we also recently announced that in q1 of 24 we plan to deprecate thirdparty cookies for 1 of chrome users and this will support developers obviously in conducting their realworld experiments to assess the readiness and effectiveness of their products without thirdparty cookies and were overall encouraged by the ecosystem engagement on privacy sandbox well continue to work with the industry and regulators in how these technologies can support the transition to frankly a more private web operator and our last question comes from mark mahaney with evercore your line is now open mark mahaney evercore isi thank you two questions please ruth you talked about these elevated levels of investments in q4 and in 24 im sorry were you referring to just capex or capex and total expenses and then on the comments around stabilization in cloud is this something that you just started to see in the september quarter or had you seen that starting earlier in the year and if you just started seeing it in the september quarter would you have any thoughts on why you would have seen it why google cloud would have seen it maybe later than some of the other hyperscalers thank you ruth porat president and chief investment officer cfo alphabet and google so i think what youre referring to was my capex comment i was trying to make the point that we are committed to meaningfully investing in capex given all the opportunities we see we do continue to expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure it will be increasing in the fourth quarter and talked about some of the difference in timing muted timing in the third quarter due to the timing of supplier payments and then tried to make it clear that we will continue to grow capex in 2024 or more specifically to your question 2024 aggregate capex will be above the full year 2023 so that was the main one and then as it relates to cloud as sundar said what were really excited about is the revenue growth does reflect healthy customer adoption across the portfolio and thats infrastructure data analytics its security and so i cant comment on others but we feel good about where were sitting here and looking forward and well let you do the forecasting gcp growth in the third quarter was above the growth rate for cloud overall and we feel really good about the work that theyre doing there and then of course in addition to that is all of the contribution from google workspace operator thank you and that concludes our questionandanswer session for today id like to turn the conference back over to jim friedland for any further remarks jim friedland director investor relations thanks everyone for joining us today we look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter 2023 call thank you and have a good evening operator thank you everyone this concludes todays conference call thank you for participating you may now disconnect'"

participants are in listen-only mode.', 'After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.', 'To ask a question during the session, you will need to press *1 on your telephone.', 'I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations.', 'Please go ahead.', 'Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet’s Third Quarter 2023 Earnings conference call.', 'With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat.', 'Now I’ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor.', 'Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking.', 'Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.', 'Actual results could differ materially.', 'Please refer to our Form 10-K, including our risk factor section and our Form 10-Qs.', 'We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.', 'During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.', 'A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.', 'Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise.', 'And now I’ll turn the call over to Sundar.', 'Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Jim.', 'And hello, everyone.', 'I’m pleased with our business results this quarter, which demonstrate strong growth in Search and YouTube, and momentum in Cloud.', 'Google turned 25 in September, which offered an opportunity to reflect on our progress over the last quarter century, and to look ahead to the opportunities enabled by AI we are so excited and confident about.', 'Our product momentum continued this quarter, as you saw with Cloud Next, Made on YouTube and Made by Google.', 'It’s all part of our focus on making AI more helpful for everyone, and we are making good progress across the four areas that we shared last quarter.', 'First, improving knowledge and learning.', 'This includes our work with the Search Generative Experience, which is our experiment to bring generative AI capabilities into Search.', 'We’ve learned a lot from people trying it, and we’ve added new capabilities, like incorporating videos and images into responses and generating imagery.', 'We’ve also made it easier to understand and debug generated code.', 'Direct user feedback has been positive, with strong growth in adoption.', 'In August, we opened up availability to India and Japan, with more countries and languages to come.', 'As we add features and expand into new markets, we’re engaging with the broader ecosystem and will continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users, send valuable traffic to publishers, and support a healthy, open Internet.', 'With generative AI applied to Search, we can serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives.', 'We are surfacing more links with SGE, and linking to a wider range of sources on the results page, creating new opportunities for content to be discovered.', 'Of course, ads will continue to play an important role in this new Search experience.', 'People are finding ads helpful here, as they provide useful options to take action and connect with businesses.', 'We’ll experiment with new formats native to SGE that use generative AI to create relevant, high-quality ads, customized to every step of the search journey.', 'The second area we are focused on is boosting creativity and productivity.', 'Bard is particularly helpful here; it’s a direct interface to a conversational LLM, and we think of it as an early experiment and complementary experience to Google Search.', 'Bard can now integrate with Google apps and services, showing relevant information from Workspace, Maps, YouTube, and Google Flights and hotels.', 'We’ve also improved the “Google it” feature.', 'It provides other sources to help people evaluate Bard’s responses and explore information across the web.', 'Earlier this month, we announced Assistant with Bard -- a personal assistant powered by generative AI.', 'It combines Bard’s generative and reasoning capabilities with Assistant’s personalized help.', 'You can interact with it through text, voice or images, and in the coming months, you’ll be able to opt in on Android and iOS mobile devices.', 'Our collaborative tools in Workspace and YouTube are also part of how we boost creativity and productivity, and they are seeing great initial traction.', 'Third, we are enabling developers, businesses and other organizations to build their own transformative products and services.', 'For example, thousands of customers and partners are already using Google Cloud to capture the potential of AI, and we’ll share more there in a minute.', 'And fourth, we are building and deploying AI responsibly, so that everyone can benefit.', 'One area we are focused on is making sure people can more easily identify when they are encountering AI-generated content online.', 'Using new technology powered by Google DeepMind SynthID, images generated by Vertex AI can be watermarked in a way that is invisible to the human eye, without reducing the image quality.', 'Underlying all this work is the foundational research done by our teams at Google DeepMind and Google Research.', 'We are excited to roll out more of what they’ve been working on soon.', 'As we expand access to our new AI services, we continue to make meaningful investments in support of our AI efforts.', 'We remain committed to durably re-engineering our cost base in order to help create capacity for these investments, in support of long-term, sustainable financial value.', 'Across Alphabet, teams are looking at ways to operate as effectively as possible, focused on their biggest priorities.', 'Turning next to YouTube, which saw solid momentum in both its ads and subscription businesses in Q3.', 'NFL Sunday Ticket is now live and receiving excellent reviews.', 'Fans love our multiview feature, which can livestream up to four games on a single screen.', 'We have heard positive feedback from our partners at the NFL about the new features and livestream reliability.', 'This is a clear example of our ability to execute big partnerships with excellence and at scale.', 'I’m really pleased with the growth and engagement on YouTube Shorts.', 'We continue to work on closing the monetization gap here.', 'Shorts now average over 70 billion daily views and are watched by over 2 billion signed-in users every month.', 'At Made On YouTube in September, we announced new tools that make it easier to create engaging content.', 'Dream Screen is an experimental feature that allows creators to add AI-generated video or image backgrounds to Shorts.', 'And YouTube Create is a new mobile app with a suite of production tools for editing Shorts, longer videos or both.', 'Next, Google Cloud.', 'We see continued growth, with Q3 revenue of $8.4 billion, up 22%.', 'Today, more than 60% of the world’s thousand-largest companies are Google Cloud customers.', 'At Cloud Next, we showcased amazing innovations across our entire portfolio of Infrastructure, Data and AI, Workspace Collaboration, and Cybersecurity solutions.', 'We offer advanced AI-optimized infrastructure to train and serve models at scale, and today, more than half of all funded generative AI startups are Google Cloud customers.', 'This includes AI21 Labs, Contextual, Elemental Cognition, Writer, and more.', 'We continue to provide the widest choice of accelerator options.', 'Our A3 VMs powered by NVIDIA’s H100 GPU are generally available, and we are winning customers with Cloud TPU v5e, our most cost-efficient and versatile accelerator to date.', 'On top of our infrastructure, our Vertex AI platform helps customers build, deploy and scale AI-powered applications.', 'We offer more than 100 models -- including popular third-party and open-source models, as well as tools to quickly build Search and Conversation use cases.', 'From Q2 to Q3, the number of active generative AI projects on Vertex AI grew by 7X, including Highmark Health, which is creating more personalized member materials.', 'Duet AI was created using Google’s leading large foundation models and is specially trained to help users to be more productive on Google Cloud.', 'We continue expanding its capabilities and integrating it across a wide range of Cloud products and services.', 'With Duet AI, we’re helping leading brands like PayPal and Deutsche Bank boost developer productivity.', 'And we are enabling retailers like Aritzia and Gymshark to gain new insights for better and faster business results.', 'In fact, companies are increasingly using AI for the purpose of analyzing data, and customers are choosing Google Cloud because we are the only large cloud provider with a unified platform to analyze structured and unstructured data.', 'In Workspace, thousands of companies and more than a million trusted testers have used Duet AI.', 'They are writing and refining content in Gmail and Docs, creating original images from text within Slides, organizing data in Sheets, and more.', 'These innovations enable us to provide new services and grow our base of 10 million paying customers, including enterprises like Grupo Boticario, Unilever and Warner Music.', 'We also integrated Duet AI across our cybersecurity portfolio to differentiate in the marketplace, providing generative AI-powered assistance in Mandiant Threat Intelligence, Chronicle Security Operations and Security Command Center.', 'This reduces the time security teams spend writing, running and refining searches by seven times.', 'We are the only leading security provider that combines frontline intelligence and expertise, a modern security operations platform, and a trusted cloud foundation, all infused with generative AI -- helping protect customers and partners like BT, Jack Henry and Associates, and CoverMyMeds.', 'Turning to hardware.', 'We unveiled our new products this month.', 'We introduced our new Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel Watch 2 to very positive consumer feedback and reviews.', 'Pixel is the fastest-growing smartphone brand in our top markets, and the only one that grew in units sold year over year.', 'Our portfolio of Pixel products are brought to life thanks to our combination of foundational technologies -- AI, Android and Google Tensor.', 'Google Tensor G3 is the third generation of our tailor-built chip.', 'It’s designed to power transformative experiences by bringing the latest in Google AI research directly to our newest phones.', 'And new AI-powered editing features in Google Photos on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro remove distractions, generate the best shot from multiple images, and reduce distracting sounds in videos.', 'Pixel and our third-party ecosystem are powered by Android.', 'We just released Android 14 with more accessibility features.', 'I also want to mention Chromebooks Plus, a new category which provides the best of Chrome on great hardware, with built-in Google apps and powerful AI capabilities.', 'We also shared that Chromebooks will now get regular automatic updates for 10 years -- more than any other operating system.', 'In Other Bets, Waymo is onboarding more riders to its commercial ride-hailing service as it gradually adds over 100,000 people from its San Francisco waitlist.', 'Austin will follow as its next ride-hail city.', 'Wing and Walmart announced a new partnership to provide drone delivery service in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.', 'Before handing over to Philipp, I want to thank our employees around the world who are working to create innovative products and provide great services to people and businesses who use our products.', 'Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Thanks, Sundar.', 'And hi, everyone.', 'I’ll start with our performance for the quarter and then give color into the three key priority areas for Ads -- Google AI, Retail, and YouTube -- that we’ve identified on past calls as opportunities for long-term growth in advertising.', 'Google Services revenues of $68 billion were up 11% year-on-year.', 'In Google Advertising, Search & Other, revenues grew 11% year-on-year, led by solid growth in the Retail vertical.', 'In YouTube Ads, revenues were up 12% year-on-year, driven by growth in both brand and direct response.', 'In Network, revenues declined 3% year-on-year.', 'Google Other revenues were up 21% year-on-year, led by strong growth in YouTube subscription revenues.', 'Let’s start with Google AI.', 'Recent dramatic advances in everything from foundational research models, to LLMs, to generative AI are improving our ability to deliver better performance and profitability for advertisers and more helpful, delightful experiences for users.', 'We covered many innovations last quarter after GML, like our conversational experience in Google Ads, significant updates to Performance Max and new campaign types like Demand Gen.\\nAnd as Sundar said, we’re continuing to experiment with new ad formats on SGE.', 'It’s extremely important to us that in this new experience, advertisers still have the opportunity to reach potential customers along their search journeys.', 'I’ll highlight more ways we’re innovating with the best of Google AI as we double-click into our core business.', 'In retail, we had a great quarter.', 'In a market where every dollar counts, our proven AI-powered solutions like Search and PMax are helping retailers drive reliable, strong ROI and meet customers wherever they are across the funnel.', 'In Q3, we also started prepping retailers for what will be a long holiday season.', 'Let me share some themes.', 'Number one - With the maximum number of days between Thanksgiving and Christmas -- and expectations for many micro-peaks beyond Cyber 5 -- we’re arming businesses with insights and planning tools, including Optiscore and Performance Planner, to uncover new opportunities, plan budgets and targets to stay competitive, and be smarter with their inventory and pricing strategy.', 'Number two - Consumer expectations are shifting, especially around price and convenience.', 'We’ve seen 4X “deals’’ queries during the holidays versus other periods.', '75% of users say they’ll shop with those offering free shipping.', 'Retailers are capitalizing on these trends with our differentiated merchant offerings like merchant promotions and fulfillment options, and we’re making improvements to significantly boost the number of deals shown to shoppers in Search this holiday season.', 'Look out for more in the coming days about new ways we’ll help shoppers browse deals across the web this year.', 'Number three - No surprise, Omnichannel is the way to succeed.', 'With our suite of omni-product solutions including Local Inventory Ads, omnibidding, and PMax for Store Goals, retailers big and small are capturing demand and incremental store budgets while engaging with high-value customers.', 'Innovation continues across our shopping and merchant experiences, powered by Google AI.', 'Our virtual try-on tool for apparel launched in June and has been a hit with consumers and brands.', 'Users engage with virtual try-on images at a higher rate versus regular brand-provided images.', 'Product Studio is another launch from GML getting positive feedback in pilot mode.', 'It uses the best of gen AI to help businesses create unique and tailored imagery for free that they can then scale across their channels.', 'We’re seeing early merchant testers using it to “seasonalize” their content for the holidays.', 'Let’s shift to YouTube.', 'It’s worth repeating: our intense focus on creator success coupled with our multiformat strategy are at the center of how we think about YouTube’s long-term growth.', 'Shorts, Connected TV and our subscription offerings are key drivers here, and we’re investing across each to solidify YouTube’s position as the best place to create, the best place to watch and the best place to deliver results.', 'Sundar mentioned watchtime and engagement momentum on Shorts as well as our monetization progress.', 'He also covered subscription growth and NFL Sunday Ticket.', 'As for Connected TV, we continue to be the number one overall streaming destination according to Nielsen.', '150 million+ people are watching YouTube on CTV screens every month in the U.S.', 'Whether it’s music videos, NFL Sunday Ticket, free movies, Shorts, a continuous stream of MrBeast or some other creator-led content, viewers want choice and variety and we’re giving it to them all in one place.', 'And to help creators and advertisers connect with these billions of viewers across moments, screens and formats, we’re bringing Google AI to awesome new creation tools and ad solutions.', 'AI will do wonders for creation and storytelling.', 'From Dream Screen and YouTube Create -- which Sundar talked about -- to features that autodub content in multiple languages, flip and trim existing assets, remix and clip videos, and more, we’re just getting started.', 'We’re also helping brands break through at speed and scale across the funnel to drive results.', 'Spotlight Moments launched last week.', 'It uses AI to identify trending content around major cultural moments for brand sponsorship opportunities.', 'There’s Video Reach Campaigns, which are expanding to in-feed and Shorts and will be generally available in November.', 'AI is helping advertisers find as many people as possible in their ideal audience for the lowest possible price.', 'Early tests are delivering 54% more reach at 42% lower cost.', 'And then with Video View campaigns, AI is serving skippable ads across in-stream, in-feed, and Shorts and helping advertisers earn the maximum number of views at the lowest possible cost.', 'So far, they’re driving 40% more views, on average, versus in-stream alone.', 'Then for YouTube and other feed-based surfaces, there’s our new Demand Gen campaign which launched in April, rolled out worldwide last week, and was designed for the needs of today’s social marketers to engage people as they stream, scroll and connect.', 'It combines video and image ads in one campaign, with access to 3 billion users across YouTube and Google, and the ability to optimize and measure across the funnel using Google AI.', 'Demand Gen is already driving success for brands like Samsung and Toyota.', 'Before I wrap, one quick highlight on our close collaboration and commitment to our most important ecosystems and partners.', 'In July, we launched Google News Showcase in the U.S., our curated online news experience and licensing program, with more than 150 news publications, 90% of which are local or regional.', 'Globally, over 2,500 news publications have signed on to News Showcase, and the product is live in 23 countries to date.', 'Our commitment to open access to news and information remains strong.', 'With that, I’ll end with a thank you to our customers and partners around the world for their continued trust and collaboration, and our Googlers everywhere for their incredible hard work and dedication.', 'Ruth, over to you.', 'Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Philipp.', 'We are very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter, driven by meaningful growth in Search and YouTube, and momentum in Cloud.', 'My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state otherwise.', 'I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook.', 'For the third quarter, our Consolidated Revenues were $76.7 billion, up 11% in both reported and constant currency.', 'Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth.', 'In terms of expenses, Total Cost of Revenues was $33.2 billion, up 7%, primarily reflecting Other Cost of Revenues of $20.6 billion, which was up 6%.', 'Growth here was primarily driven by Content Acquisition Costs, mainly for YouTube subscription offerings.', 'As noted in our earnings release, the overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives we made starting in the first quarter of the year.', 'Operating expenses were $22.1 billion, up 6%, reflecting the following: First, an increase in R&D expenses, driven primarily by compensation; second, an increase in G&A expenses reflecting the impact of charges related to legal matters; and finally, Sales & Marketing expenses, which were relatively flat to last year.', 'Operating income was $21.3 billion, up 25%, and our operating margin was 28%.', 'Other Income & Expense was a loss of $146 million.', 'Net income was $19.7 billion.', 'This reflects an effective tax rate of 7% in the third quarter from an IRS change related to the use of foreign tax credits which had an outsized impact on the third-quarter rate, because the change resulted in a catch-up for prior periods.', 'We delivered Free Cash Flow of $22.6 billion in the third quarter and $78 billion for the trailing 12 months.', 'We ended the quarter with $120 billion in cash and marketable securities.', 'As a reminder, our cash balance and free cash flow in the second and third quarters benefited from the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter of 2023.', 'As noted in our earnings release, on October 16 we made an estimated tax payment of $10.5 billion related to this deferral, which will be reflected in our cash balance and free cash flow in the fourth quarter.', 'Turning to segment results, within Google Services, Revenues were $68 billion, up 11%.', 'Google Search and Other advertising revenues of $44 billion in the quarter were up 11%, led again by growth in retail.', 'YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion, were up 12% driven by both brand advertising and direct response.', 'Network advertising revenues of $7.7 billion were down 3%.', 'Other Revenues were $8.3 billion, up 21%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues, driven by subscriber growth in YouTube TV, followed by YouTube Music Premium.', 'Google Services Operating Income was $23.9 billion, up 27%, and the operating margin was 35%.', 'Turning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $8.4 billion for the quarter, up 22%.', 'GCP revenue growth remained strong across geographies, industries and products, although the Q3 year-on-year growth rate reflects the impact of customer optimization efforts.', 'Google Workspace also delivered strong revenue growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat.', 'Google Cloud had Operating Income of $266 million, and the operating margin was 3%.', 'As to our Other Bets, for the third quarter, revenues were $297 million and the operating loss was $1.2 billion.', 'Turning to our outlook for the business, with respect to Google Services.', 'First, within Advertising, after a period of historic volatility, we were pleased with the year-on-year revenue growth of Search and YouTube advertising in the third quarter.', 'Second, within Other Revenues, in our YouTube subscription products, the substantial growth in revenues primarily reflects subscriber growth.', 'Looking ahead, a full quarter of NFL Sunday Ticket revenues, as well as associated content acquisition costs, will be reflected in Q4 results, compared to only a few weeks in the third quarter.', 'Play had solid growth in the third quarter, driven primarily by an increase in the number of buyers.', 'With respect to Hardware, there is a headwind to revenues in the fourth quarter, reflecting efforts to optimize the portfolio with tighter targeting of our go-to-market investments, as well as the ongoing impact from the difference in launch timing for the Pixel 6a and 7a that we mentioned last quarter.', 'Turning to Google Cloud, we are pleased with the ongoing customer engagement with GCP and Workspace, and the potential benefit of our AI solutions -- including infrastructure and services such as VertexAI and Duet.', 'We continue to invest aggressively, given the significant potential we see, while remaining focused on profitable growth.', 'In terms of expenses and profitability, we’re pleased with our operating performance.', 'As we have repeatedly stressed, we remain focused on durably re-engineering our cost base to create investment capacity to support our growth priorities, most important of which is with AI.', 'We have a number of workstreams in place:\\n\\nFirst, we are maintaining a slower pace of headcount growth, reflecting product prioritization and reallocation of talent to support our most important growth opportunities.', 'Second, we remain focused on optimizing our real estate footprint, including how and where we work, to reduce our expense growth.', 'As you can see from our earnings release, we incurred $207 million in accelerated rent and depreciation in the third quarter related to these actions.', 'Third, we have engineering workstreams underway to improve productivity across Alphabet.', 'Given the magnitude of investment in our technical infrastructure, we have a superb team focused on efficiency of our operations there.', 'We are also making progress in streamlining operations across Alphabet through the use of AI.', 'Finally, there are ongoing workstreams that are improving the efficiency of our spend with suppliers and vendors through our central procurement organization.', 'And to be clear, across the portfolio of Other Bets companies, we have also been working to identify opportunities to create sharper focus and to operate more efficiently and effectively.', 'With respect to sequential quarter-on-quarter trends, two further points: First, Cost of Sales in the fourth quarter will reflect both higher hardware costs given Pixel family launches, as well as increased CAC for YouTube as previously noted.', 'Second, as usual, we expect Sales and Marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the end of the year in part to support product launches and the holiday season.', 'Finally, our reported capex in Q3 was $8 billion, driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component for servers, followed by data centers, reflecting a meaningful increase in our investments in AI compute.', 'The growth in reported cash capex in Q3 is somewhat muted due to the timing of supplier payments, which can cause variability from quarter to quarter.', 'We continue to invest meaningfully in the technical infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see in AI across Alphabet and expect elevated levels of investment, increasing in the fourth quarter of 2023 and continuing to grow in 2024.', 'In closing, we remain very excited about the opportunities ahead and committed to deliver sustainable financial value.', 'Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions.', 'As a reminder, to ask a question you will need to press star *1 on your telephone.', 'To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been asked.', 'And our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.', 'Your line is open.', 'Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great.', 'Thanks for taking my questions.', 'I have two.', 'The first one is somewhat of a jump ball.', 'There is somewhat of an investor debate about the incremental return on capital to Search when it comes to AI.', 'I know it’s early, but are there any examples that you’re seeing with SGE or Bard on higher utility, higher conversion rates, more engagement?', 'Just something to sort of show signal around the return that could come from these investments?', 'And the second one, Ruth, I know you have spoken a lot about durably re-engineering the cost base.', 'I think in the past you talked about how expenses could grow slower than revenue in 2024.', 'Is that sort of still the high-level way to think about it, or is that potentially changing a bit as investments are continuing?', 'Thanks.', 'Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Ruth, do you want to take the second part, I’ll take the first?', 'Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: Sure.', 'Thanks for that, Brian.', 'Overall, that’s sort of a truism, as you know well, that looking to grow revenues at a faster rate than expenses as we’re focused on delivering sustainable financial value, and so that really takes us to the workstreams which I tried to tick through again.', 'Those remain the driver.', 'They’re the real priority.', 'Those are the efforts that are going to enable us to keep expense growth as moderated as possible while supporting the investment growth that is so exciting in front of us, in particular around AI.', 'Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: To your first part, obviously, we see AI as a foundational platform shift and are excited about the opportunities across our business.', 'It starts with Search.', 'I’ve been pretty pleased with how the user feedback has been on SGE.', 'We are rolling it out to more users.', 'Through it all, we’re making sure the product works well and we are generating value for our ecosystem and that Ads transitions well.', 'I think I view this as, with AI, the opportunity to evolve Search and Assistant over the next decade ahead.', 'And I think as we’ve always seen, when you continue to invest and build great experiences, you can get value on the other side.', 'And I do think over time there will be newer paths, just like we’ve done on YouTube.', 'I think with the AI work, there are subscription models as a possible path as well.', 'Obviously, all of the AI investments we’re doing applies across Cloud, too, and I’m pretty optimistic about what’s ahead there as well.', 'Thank you, both.', 'Operator: Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.', 'Doug Anmuth (JPMorgan): Thanks for taking the questions.', 'One for Sundar and one for Ruth.', 'Sundar, you talked a lot about AI.', 'I was hoping you could talk more about Gemini and how it will differentiate from other models -- some of the multimodal capabilities and what new experiences or [agents] you think it could unlock and how we should think about timing.', 'And then also just on Cloud, hoping you can talk about some of the factors there on the decel in Cloud and just what you’re seeing in terms of optimizations, and is there any sign of new workload deployments taking place?', 'Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thanks, good questions.', 'So on Gemini, obviously, it’s an effort from our combined Google DeepMind team.', 'I’m very excited at the progress there and as we’re working through getting the model ready.', 'To me, more importantly, we are just really laying the foundation of what I think of as the next-generation series of models we’ll be launching all throughout 2024.', 'The pace of innovation is extraordinarily impressive to see.', 'We are creating it from the ground up to be multimodal, highly efficient with tool and API integrations, and more importantly, laying the platform to enable future innovations as well.', 'We are developing Gemini in a way that it is going to be available at various sizes and capabilities, and we’ll be using it immediately across all our products internally as well as bringing it out to both developers and Cloud customers through Vertex.', 'So I view it as a journey, and each generation is going to be better than the other.', 'And we are definitely investing, and the early results are very promising.', 'On Cloud, maybe what I would say is, overall, we have definitely started seeing customers looking to optimize spend.', 'We leaned into it to help customers, given some of the challenges they were facing, and so that was a factor.', 'But we are definitely seeing a lot of interest in AI.', 'There are many, many projects underway now.', 'Just on Vertex alone, the number of projects grew over 7X.', 'And so we see signs of stabilization, and I’m optimistic about what’s ahead.', 'Operator: Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.', 'Your line is now open.', 'Eric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs): Thank you very much for taking the questions.', 'Two, if I could.', 'Sundar, you guys led over a year ago starting with Performance Max, and I wanted to know if we could get your updated thoughts on how AI might impact the broader advertising industry and how you are aligning Alphabet and Google’s goals with AI and where it might take the advertising industry in the years ahead.', 'That would be the first question.', 'And then about a year ago, Philipp and Ruth started talking about some of the brand advertising headwinds that YouTube was facing.', 'As we start to lap those headwinds, how should we be thinking about a broad recovery in brand advertising versus elements of still headwinds that are being faced in the broader Ads spaces, specifically with YouTube?', 'Thank you.', 'Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: So maybe I take the first one.', 'We are very pleased with how Performance Max is performing.', 'It gives advertisers really a maximum performance across all inventory from one really AI-powered campaign, and it’s probably the ultimate example of AI in action across our Ads products.', 'It’s delivering excellent ROI.', 'Those using it achieve on average over 18% more conversions at a similar cost per action.', 'Since rolling it out about two years ago, we’ve continued to expand the features, give advertisers additional ways to steer how it works.', 'We have a lot of things, like account-level negative keywords, other details here.', 'We launched new lifecycle goals -- customer lifecycle goals, we called them.', 'A revamped asset creation flow that really helps business adapt and scale their most successful creatives.', 'I think that’s one to watch.', 'We will also continue to build other new PMax features based on all the advertiser feedback we’re seeing.', 'So we are very, very encouraged by the progress here.', 'Overall maybe -- there was a second part to your question, a bit on what we’re hearing from the customers out there.', 'Look, driving ROI and efficiency is still top of mind for many, right?', 'It’s a rapidly shifting and still quite unpredictable consumer landscape out there.', 'Our AI tools are very well-received.', 'AI, gen AI are top of mind for everybody really.', 'There’s a ton of excitement, lots of questions about it.', 'Many understand the value.', 'Nearly 80% of our advertisers already use at least one AI-powered Search Ads product.', 'Yeah, we’re hearing a lot of good feedback on, number one, our Ads AI Essentials, which are really helping to unlock the power of AI and set up for durable ROI growth on the advertiser side.', 'Those are products like the foundation for our data and measurement, things like Google Tag, Consent Mode and so on.', 'Obviously Search and PMax, we talked about it, and then all those gen AI products, all those different ones.', 'So there’s a whole lot of interest in those products.', 'Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: Then on to your second question regarding YouTube.', 'As we said, overall, year-on-year growth in revenues was driven by both brand advertising and direct response.', 'But very much to your question, yes, there was a stabilization in spending by advertisers.', 'We’re really pleased about that.', 'We’re particularly pleased about the ongoing performance in the Living Room and on Shorts.', 'And as I said, that’s both watchtime growth and monetization.', 'I would say the other thing benefiting YouTube is the retail strength we talked about with Search -- retail strength in APAC in both Search and YouTube.', 'That really began in the second quarter, continued in the third quarter, but that was another contributor.', 'So quite a number of things going on.', 'Feel good about the results the team was able to deliver here.', 'Eric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs): Thank you so much.', 'Operator: Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS.', 'Lloyd Walmsley (UBS): Great.', 'Thanks for taking the question.', 'Two, if I can.', 'First, as we just think about the rollout of SGE across the user base, how far along is that?', 'And how do you balance the product rollout and consumer uptake versus monetization in that transition?', 'And then the second one, also sort of generative AI-related, how quickly are you guys finding new ways of optimizing?', 'Whether that’s shrinking model sizes, chip efficiencies or anything else.', 'And do you think overall capital intensity of business scales up, or do you just find ways to do this more efficiently as usage scales?', 'Anything you can share there would be great.', 'Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: The first part about SGE, we are still in very early days in terms of how much we have rolled it out.', 'But we have definitely gotten it out to enough people, both geographically, across user segments and enough to know that the product is working well.', 'It improves the experience.', 'But there are areas to improve, which we are fine-tuning.', 'Our true north here is getting at the right user experience we want to, and I’m pretty comfortable seeing the trajectory.', 'And we’ve always worked through these transitions, be it from desktop to mobile or from now, mobile to an AI-enhanced experience.', 'So it’s nothing new, and I feel very comfortable that as we go through it, the strength of our teams -- both on the organic side as well as Ads side -- to drive the right experience for users including Ads will pay dividends.', 'I think we’ll continue to make improvements and make progress there.', 'On your second question, at a high level, I would say all through the -- we just celebrated 25 years -- and of all the things I was proud about, when I looked at the strength of the work we’ve done across our infrastructure as a company, our technical infrastructure as a company, and various given stages at a given moment in time, when we adopted new generations of technology.', 'We’ve looked at the cost of it, but then the curves, the efficiency curves we have driven on top of it, has always been phenomenal to see.', 'And I see the current moment as no different.', 'Already through this year, we are driving significant efficiencies, both in our models, in training costs and serving costs, and our ability to adapt what’s needed to the right use case.', 'And so I think we’ll do everything that is needed to make sure we have the leading AI models and infrastructure in the world, bar none.', 'And we will continue driving efficiencies from there.', 'Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.', 'Michael Nathanson (Moffett): Thank you.', 'I’m going to ask you guys a multi-part question on YouTube TV.', 'So, firstly, what were the broader objectives for getting Sunday Ticket?', 'How did it perform versus those objectives?', 'What lessons have you learned from having NFL Sunday Ticket?', 'How does that affect your appetite for more sports going forward?', 'Philipp Schindler: So, as Sundar said earlier, we are several weeks into our first season and we are very pleased with how it’s going.', 'I think in the broader context, you have to look at it as our overall YouTube subscription strategy.', 'The great feedback we’ve gotten so far on the YouTube experience is very, very significant.', 'People love the navigation and they love multiview.', 'They love the chats and the polls.', 'And frankly, people are very happy with the lack of latency here.', 'The number one piece of concrete feedback the team has gotten is actually that people want the ability to pick their own games for multiview, which is -- multiview is the awesome feature we started rolling out on YouTube TV that gives fans the ability to basically watch multiple streams here at once.', 'And, yeah, overall, the teams are working hard to build a fantastic experience, and we are really trying to stay focused on getting our first season right and providing the best possible experience really for fans here.', 'Operator: Your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America.', 'Justin Post (Bank of America): Great.', 'Thank you, a couple questions on Q4.', 'Can you provide any color on if there’s been any pause in advertising around the Middle East conflict in October?', 'Anything we should be aware of for Q4?', 'And then second, when we do think about the Sunday Ticket impact, I know you can’t give us revenues or expenses, but overall, would that be a headwind to margins in Q4 or something we should be thinking about?', 'Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: So look, on the first question, obviously this is a tragic, tragic -- there are no words to talk about what’s going on.', 'And all of our focus has been on supporting our people there and how our products can be as helpful as possible in this very painful time, broadly.', 'And so nothing really to add.', 'And then in terms of the second question, Sunday Ticket, the only thing I tried to call out there is that clearly this is the first full quarter of Sunday Ticket that is contributing overall to the subscription revenues that we see.', 'That’s in part of Other Revenues.', 'Also obviously, it is contributing to higher CAC in the fourth quarter.', 'So tried to make that really clear.', 'And as we look longer term, we expect to generate an attractive return over the life of the deal.', 'We’re continuing to invest in support of this.', 'And excited about the additional opportunities that come out of it working with partners to deliver clips and other opportunities.', 'As we’ve said, we’ve heard positive feedback from our partners at the NFL about the new features and livestream reliability.', 'And this is really a clear example of our ability to execute big partnerships with excellence at scale and really leverage a lot of the extraordinary magic at YouTube and across Google.', 'And that’s what we’re excited about.', 'Justin Post (Bank of America): Great, thank you.', 'Operator: Your next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo.', 'Ken Gawrelski (Wells Fargo): Thank you so much.', 'Two questions, if I may.', 'First, how do you think about the future structure of AI-driven Search capabilities?', 'Will activity remain centralized in a search bar, or will it be decentralized and present in many different applications, including on third-party applications?', 'You alluded to Bard being integrated into multiple Google experiences earlier in the call.', 'And then the second question is, any update on the Chrome cookie deprecation planned to begin in 1Q ’24?', 'What have you seen so far based on your early testing of Privacy Sandbox, and what advertiser feedback have you received?', 'Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: On your first question, look, you know, I broadly think of it as people are looking for information.', 'They’ve always looked for it in many, many different ways.', 'We’ve given the product search example.', 'People can directly go to Amazon, as an example, or come to Google.', 'If you zoom back and take an information view of the world, there’s always been many different ways to get it.', 'And part of our work we do in making Search be world-class and give users what they’re looking for is so that we can get at as much of that intent as possible.', 'So I don’t see that changing.', 'With mobile, there were more ways that people could get information, but we worked hard to make Search work better in the mobile world.', 'And similarly, I view with AI, there will be many ways people get information.', 'But it also offers us an opportunity in Search and in Assistant to take it to the next level and answer use cases, which we couldn’t have done before, and expand a diverse set of needs where we are a source.', 'So that’s how I see the opportunity ahead.', 'Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: And to the second part of your question: yes, Chrome still plans to begin phasing out third-party cookies in the second half of ’24.', 'In the last several months, Chrome has really made significant progress on the Privacy Sandbox with APIs for developer testing.', 'And they are now generally available in Chrome.', 'Our Ads team is testing these APIs.', 'And as we shared back in April, the preliminary results of our interest-based ads testing showed a combination of what we call privacy-preserving signals and AI optimization actually provides positive results for businesses preparing for a cookieless future.', 'We also recently announced that in Q1 of ’24 we plan to deprecate third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users, and this will support developers, obviously, in conducting their real-world experiments to assess the readiness and effectiveness of their products without third-party cookies.', 'And we’re overall encouraged by the ecosystem engagement on Privacy Sandbox.', 'We’ll continue to work with the industry and regulators in how these technologies can support the transition to, frankly, a more private web.', 'Operator: And our last question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore.', 'Mark Mahaney (Evercore ISI): Thank you.', 'Two questions, please.', 'Ruth, you talked about these elevated levels of investments in Q4 and in ’24.', 'I’m sorry, were you referring to just CapEx or CapEx and total expenses?', 'And then on the comments around stabilization in Cloud, is this something that you just started to see in the September quarter, or had you seen that starting earlier in the year?', 'And if you just started seeing it in the September quarter, would you have any thoughts on why you would have seen it, why Google Cloud would have seen it maybe later than some of the other hyperscalers?', 'Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: So I think what you’re referring to was my CapEx comment.', 'I was trying to make the point that we are committed to meaningfully investing in CapEx, given all the opportunities we see.', 'We do continue to expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure.', 'It will be increasing in the fourth quarter.', 'And talked about some of the difference in timing, muted timing in the third quarter due to the timing of supplier payments.', 'And then tried to make it clear that we will continue to grow CapEx in 2024 -- or more specifically to your question, 2024 aggregate CapEx will be above the full year 2023.', 'So that was the main one.', 'And then as it relates to Cloud, as Sundar said, what we’re really excited about is the revenue growth does reflect healthy customer adoption across the portfolio, and that’s Infrastructure, Data Analytics, it’s Security.', 'And so I can’t comment on others, but we feel good about where we’re sitting here and looking forward.', 'And we’ll let you do the forecasting.', 'GCP growth in the third quarter was above the growth rate for Cloud overall, and we feel really good about the work that they’re doing there.', 'And then, of course, in addition to that is all of the contribution from Google Workspace.', 'Operator: Thank you.', 'And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today.', 'I’d like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.', 'Jim Friedland, Director Investor Relations: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today.', 'We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter 2023 call.', 'Thank you and have a good evening.', 'Operator: Thank you, everyone.', 'This concludes today’s conference call.', 'Thank you for participating.', 'You may now disconnect.'])"

To ask a question during the session, you will need to press *1 on your telephone. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet’s Third Quarter 2023 Earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat. Now I’ll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Form 10-K, including our risk factor section and our Form 10-Qs. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. And now I’ll turn the call over to Sundar. Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Jim. And hello, everyone. I’m pleased with our business results this quarter, which demonstrate strong growth in Search and YouTube, and momentum in Cloud. Google turned 25 in September, which offered an opportunity to reflect on our progress over the last quarter century, and to look ahead to the opportunities enabled by AI we are so excited and confident about. Our product momentum continued this quarter, as you saw with Cloud Next, Made on YouTube and Made by Google. It’s all part of our focus on making AI more helpful for everyone, and we are making good progress across the four areas that we shared last quarter. First, improving knowledge and learning. This includes our work with the Search Generative Experience, which is our experiment to bring generative AI capabilities into Search. We’ve learned a lot from people trying it, and we’ve added new capabilities, like incorporating videos and images into responses and generating imagery. We’ve also made it easier to understand and debug generated code. Direct user feedback has been positive, with strong growth in adoption. In August, we opened up availability to India and Japan, with more countries and languages to come. As we add features and expand into new markets, we’re engaging with the broader ecosystem and will continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users, send valuable traffic to publishers, and support a healthy, open Internet. With generative AI applied to Search, we can serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives. We are surfacing more links with SGE, and linking to a wider range of sources on the results page, creating new opportunities for content to be discovered. Of course, ads will continue to play an important role in this new Search experience. People are finding ads helpful here, as they provide useful options to take action and connect with businesses. We’ll experiment with new formats native to SGE that use generative AI to create relevant, high-quality ads, customized to every step of the search journey. The second area we are focused on is boosting creativity and productivity. Bard is particularly helpful here; it’s a direct interface to a conversational LLM, and we think of it as an early experiment and complementary experience to Google Search. Bard can now integrate with Google apps and services, showing relevant information from Workspace, Maps, YouTube, and Google Flights and hotels. We’ve also improved the “Google it” feature. It provides other sources to help people evaluate Bard’s responses and explore information across the web. Earlier this month, we announced Assistant with Bard -- a personal assistant powered by generative AI. It combines Bard’s generative and reasoning capabilities with Assistant’s personalized help. You can interact with it through text, voice or images, and in the coming months, you’ll be able to opt in on Android and iOS mobile devices. Our collaborative tools in Workspace and YouTube are also part of how we boost creativity and productivity, and they are seeing great initial traction. Third, we are enabling developers, businesses and other organizations to build their own transformative products and services. For example, thousands of customers and partners are already using Google Cloud to capture the potential of AI, and we’ll share more there in a minute. And fourth, we are building and deploying AI responsibly, so that everyone can benefit. One area we are focused on is making sure people can more easily identify when they are encountering AI-generated content online. Using new technology powered by Google DeepMind SynthID, images generated by Vertex AI can be watermarked in a way that is invisible to the human eye, without reducing the image quality. Underlying all this work is the foundational research done by our teams at Google DeepMind and Google Research. We are excited to roll out more of what they’ve been working on soon. As we expand access to our new AI services, we continue to make meaningful investments in support of our AI efforts. We remain committed to durably re-engineering our cost base in order to help create capacity for these investments, in support of long-term, sustainable financial value. Across Alphabet, teams are looking at ways to operate as effectively as possible, focused on their biggest priorities. Turning next to YouTube, which saw solid momentum in both its ads and subscription businesses in Q3. NFL Sunday Ticket is now live and receiving excellent reviews. Fans love our multiview feature, which can livestream up to four games on a single screen. We have heard positive feedback from our partners at the NFL about the new features and livestream reliability. This is a clear example of our ability to execute big partnerships with excellence and at scale. I’m really pleased with the growth and engagement on YouTube Shorts. We continue to work on closing the monetization gap here. Shorts now average over 70 billion daily views and are watched by over 2 billion signed-in users every month. At Made On YouTube in September, we announced new tools that make it easier to create engaging content. Dream Screen is an experimental feature that allows creators to add AI-generated video or image backgrounds to Shorts. And YouTube Create is a new mobile app with a suite of production tools for editing Shorts, longer videos or both. Next, Google Cloud. We see continued growth, with Q3 revenue of $8.4 billion, up 22%. Today, more than 60% of the world’s thousand-largest companies are Google Cloud customers. At Cloud Next, we showcased amazing innovations across our entire portfolio of Infrastructure, Data and AI, Workspace Collaboration, and Cybersecurity solutions. We offer advanced AI-optimized infrastructure to train and serve models at scale, and today, more than half of all funded generative AI startups are Google Cloud customers. This includes AI21 Labs, Contextual, Elemental Cognition, Writer, and more. We continue to provide the widest choice of accelerator options. Our A3 VMs powered by NVIDIA’s H100 GPU are generally available, and we are winning customers with Cloud TPU v5e, our most cost-efficient and versatile accelerator to date. On top of our infrastructure, our Vertex AI platform helps customers build, deploy and scale AI-powered applications. We offer more than 100 models -- including popular third-party and open-source models, as well as tools to quickly build Search and Conversation use cases. From Q2 to Q3, the number of active generative AI projects on Vertex AI grew by 7X, including Highmark Health, which is creating more personalized member materials. Duet AI was created using Google’s leading large foundation models and is specially trained to help users to be more productive on Google Cloud. We continue expanding its capabilities and integrating it across a wide range of Cloud products and services. With Duet AI, we’re helping leading brands like PayPal and Deutsche Bank boost developer productivity. And we are enabling retailers like Aritzia and Gymshark to gain new insights for better and faster business results. In fact, companies are increasingly using AI for the purpose of analyzing data, and customers are choosing Google Cloud because we are the only large cloud provider with a unified platform to analyze structured and unstructured data. In Workspace, thousands of companies and more than a million trusted testers have used Duet AI. They are writing and refining content in Gmail and Docs, creating original images from text within Slides, organizing data in Sheets, and more. These innovations enable us to provide new services and grow our base of 10 million paying customers, including enterprises like Grupo Boticario, Unilever and Warner Music. We also integrated Duet AI across our cybersecurity portfolio to differentiate in the marketplace, providing generative AI-powered assistance in Mandiant Threat Intelligence, Chronicle Security Operations and Security Command Center. This reduces the time security teams spend writing, running and refining searches by seven times. We are the only leading security provider that combines frontline intelligence and expertise, a modern security operations platform, and a trusted cloud foundation, all infused with generative AI -- helping protect customers and partners like BT, Jack Henry and Associates, and CoverMyMeds. Turning to hardware. We unveiled our new products this month. We introduced our new Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro and Pixel Watch 2 to very positive consumer feedback and reviews. Pixel is the fastest-growing smartphone brand in our top markets, and the only one that grew in units sold year over year. Our portfolio of Pixel products are brought to life thanks to our combination of foundational technologies -- AI, Android and Google Tensor. Google Tensor G3 is the third generation of our tailor-built chip. It’s designed to power transformative experiences by bringing the latest in Google AI research directly to our newest phones. And new AI-powered editing features in Google Photos on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro remove distractions, generate the best shot from multiple images, and reduce distracting sounds in videos. Pixel and our third-party ecosystem are powered by Android. We just released Android 14 with more accessibility features. I also want to mention Chromebooks Plus, a new category which provides the best of Chrome on great hardware, with built-in Google apps and powerful AI capabilities. We also shared that Chromebooks will now get regular automatic updates for 10 years -- more than any other operating system. In Other Bets, Waymo is onboarding more riders to its commercial ride-hailing service as it gradually adds over 100,000 people from its San Francisco waitlist. Austin will follow as its next ride-hail city. Wing and Walmart announced a new partnership to provide drone delivery service in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Before handing over to Philipp, I want to thank our employees around the world who are working to create innovative products and provide great services to people and businesses who use our products. Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: Thanks, Sundar. And hi, everyone. <mark>I’ll start with our performance for the quarter and then give color into the three key priority areas for Ads -- Google AI, Retail, and YouTube -- that we’ve identified on past calls as opportunities for long-term growth in advertising.</mark> Google Services revenues of $68 billion were up 11% year-on-year. In Google Advertising, Search & Other, revenues grew 11% year-on-year, led by solid growth in the Retail vertical. In YouTube Ads, revenues were up 12% year-on-year, driven by growth in both brand and direct response. In Network, revenues declined 3% year-on-year. Google Other revenues were up 21% year-on-year, led by strong growth in YouTube subscription revenues. Let’s start with Google AI. Recent dramatic advances in everything from foundational research models, to LLMs, to generative AI are improving our ability to deliver better performance and profitability for advertisers and more helpful, delightful experiences for users. <mark>We covered many innovations last quarter after GML, like our conversational experience in Google Ads, significant updates to Performance Max and new campaign types like Demand Gen.\n",
              "And as Sundar said, we’re continuing to experiment with new ad formats on SGE.</mark> It’s extremely important to us that in this new experience, advertisers still have the opportunity to reach potential customers along their search journeys. I’ll highlight more ways we’re innovating with the best of Google AI as we double-click into our core business. In retail, we had a great quarter. In a market where every dollar counts, our proven AI-powered solutions like Search and PMax are helping retailers drive reliable, strong ROI and meet customers wherever they are across the funnel. In Q3, we also started prepping retailers for what will be a long holiday season. Let me share some themes. Number one - With the maximum number of days between Thanksgiving and Christmas -- and expectations for many micro-peaks beyond Cyber 5 -- we’re arming businesses with insights and planning tools, including Optiscore and Performance Planner, to uncover new opportunities, plan budgets and targets to stay competitive, and be smarter with their inventory and pricing strategy. Number two - Consumer expectations are shifting, especially around price and convenience. We’ve seen 4X “deals’’ queries during the holidays versus other periods. 75% of users say they’ll shop with those offering free shipping. Retailers are capitalizing on these trends with our differentiated merchant offerings like merchant promotions and fulfillment options, and we’re making improvements to significantly boost the number of deals shown to shoppers in Search this holiday season. Look out for more in the coming days about new ways we’ll help shoppers browse deals across the web this year. Number three - No surprise, Omnichannel is the way to succeed. With our suite of omni-product solutions including Local Inventory Ads, omnibidding, and PMax for Store Goals, retailers big and small are capturing demand and incremental store budgets while engaging with high-value customers. Innovation continues across our shopping and merchant experiences, powered by Google AI. Our virtual try-on tool for apparel launched in June and has been a hit with consumers and brands. Users engage with virtual try-on images at a higher rate versus regular brand-provided images. Product Studio is another launch from GML getting positive feedback in pilot mode. It uses the best of gen AI to help businesses create unique and tailored imagery for free that they can then scale across their channels. We’re seeing early merchant testers using it to “seasonalize” their content for the holidays. Let’s shift to YouTube. It’s worth repeating: our intense focus on creator success coupled with our multiformat strategy are at the center of how we think about YouTube’s long-term growth. Shorts, Connected TV and our subscription offerings are key drivers here, and we’re investing across each to solidify YouTube’s position as the best place to create, the best place to watch and the best place to deliver results. Sundar mentioned watchtime and engagement momentum on Shorts as well as our monetization progress. He also covered subscription growth and NFL Sunday Ticket. As for Connected TV, we continue to be the number one overall streaming destination according to Nielsen. 150 million+ people are watching YouTube on CTV screens every month in the U.S. Whether it’s music videos, NFL Sunday Ticket, free movies, Shorts, a continuous stream of MrBeast or some other creator-led content, viewers want choice and variety and we’re giving it to them all in one place. And to help creators and advertisers connect with these billions of viewers across moments, screens and formats, we’re bringing Google AI to awesome new creation tools and ad solutions. AI will do wonders for creation and storytelling. From Dream Screen and YouTube Create -- which Sundar talked about -- to features that autodub content in multiple languages, flip and trim existing assets, remix and clip videos, and more, we’re just getting started. We’re also helping brands break through at speed and scale across the funnel to drive results. Spotlight Moments launched last week. It uses AI to identify trending content around major cultural moments for brand sponsorship opportunities. There’s Video Reach Campaigns, which are expanding to in-feed and Shorts and will be generally available in November. AI is helping advertisers find as many people as possible in their ideal audience for the lowest possible price. Early tests are delivering 54% more reach at 42% lower cost. And then with Video View campaigns, AI is serving skippable ads across in-stream, in-feed, and Shorts and helping advertisers earn the maximum number of views at the lowest possible cost. So far, they’re driving 40% more views, on average, versus in-stream alone. Then for YouTube and other feed-based surfaces, there’s our new Demand Gen campaign which launched in April, rolled out worldwide last week, and was designed for the needs of today’s social marketers to engage people as they stream, scroll and connect. <mark>It combines video and image ads in one campaign, with access to 3 billion users across YouTube and Google, and the ability to optimize and measure across the funnel using Google AI.</mark> Demand Gen is already driving success for brands like Samsung and Toyota. Before I wrap, one quick highlight on our close collaboration and commitment to our most important ecosystems and partners. In July, we launched Google News Showcase in the U.S., our curated online news experience and licensing program, with more than 150 news publications, 90% of which are local or regional. Globally, over 2,500 news publications have signed on to News Showcase, and the product is live in 23 countries to date. Our commitment to open access to news and information remains strong. With that, I’ll end with a thank you to our customers and partners around the world for their continued trust and collaboration, and our Googlers everywhere for their incredible hard work and dedication. Ruth, over to you. Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter, driven by meaningful growth in Search and YouTube, and momentum in Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook. For the third quarter, our Consolidated Revenues were $76.7 billion, up 11% in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of expenses, Total Cost of Revenues was $33.2 billion, up 7%, primarily reflecting Other Cost of Revenues of $20.6 billion, which was up 6%. Growth here was primarily driven by Content Acquisition Costs, mainly for YouTube subscription offerings. As noted in our earnings release, the overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives we made starting in the first quarter of the year. Operating expenses were $22.1 billion, up 6%, reflecting the following: First, an increase in R&D expenses, driven primarily by compensation; second, an increase in G&A expenses reflecting the impact of charges related to legal matters; and finally, Sales & Marketing expenses, which were relatively flat to last year. Operating income was $21.3 billion, up 25%, and our operating margin was 28%. Other Income & Expense was a loss of $146 million. Net income was $19.7 billion. This reflects an effective tax rate of 7% in the third quarter from an IRS change related to the use of foreign tax credits which had an outsized impact on the third-quarter rate, because the change resulted in a catch-up for prior periods. We delivered Free Cash Flow of $22.6 billion in the third quarter and $78 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $120 billion in cash and marketable securities. As a reminder, our cash balance and free cash flow in the second and third quarters benefited from the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter of 2023. As noted in our earnings release, on October 16 we made an estimated tax payment of $10.5 billion related to this deferral, which will be reflected in our cash balance and free cash flow in the fourth quarter. Turning to segment results, within Google Services, Revenues were $68 billion, up 11%. Google Search and Other advertising revenues of $44 billion in the quarter were up 11%, led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion, were up 12% driven by both brand advertising and direct response. Network advertising revenues of $7.7 billion were down 3%. Other Revenues were $8.3 billion, up 21%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues, driven by subscriber growth in YouTube TV, followed by YouTube Music Premium. Google Services Operating Income was $23.9 billion, up 27%, and the operating margin was 35%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $8.4 billion for the quarter, up 22%. GCP revenue growth remained strong across geographies, industries and products, although the Q3 year-on-year growth rate reflects the impact of customer optimization efforts. Google Workspace also delivered strong revenue growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had Operating Income of $266 million, and the operating margin was 3%. As to our Other Bets, for the third quarter, revenues were $297 million and the operating loss was $1.2 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business, with respect to Google Services. First, within Advertising, after a period of historic volatility, we were pleased with the year-on-year revenue growth of Search and YouTube advertising in the third quarter. Second, within Other Revenues, in our YouTube subscription products, the substantial growth in revenues primarily reflects subscriber growth. Looking ahead, a full quarter of NFL Sunday Ticket revenues, as well as associated content acquisition costs, will be reflected in Q4 results, compared to only a few weeks in the third quarter. Play had solid growth in the third quarter, driven primarily by an increase in the number of buyers. With respect to Hardware, there is a headwind to revenues in the fourth quarter, reflecting efforts to optimize the portfolio with tighter targeting of our go-to-market investments, as well as the ongoing impact from the difference in launch timing for the Pixel 6a and 7a that we mentioned last quarter. Turning to Google Cloud, we are pleased with the ongoing customer engagement with GCP and Workspace, and the potential benefit of our AI solutions -- including infrastructure and services such as VertexAI and Duet. We continue to invest aggressively, given the significant potential we see, while remaining focused on profitable growth. In terms of expenses and profitability, we’re pleased with our operating performance. As we have repeatedly stressed, we remain focused on durably re-engineering our cost base to create investment capacity to support our growth priorities, most important of which is with AI. We have a number of workstreams in place:\n",
              "\n",
              "First, we are maintaining a slower pace of headcount growth, reflecting product prioritization and reallocation of talent to support our most important growth opportunities. Second, we remain focused on optimizing our real estate footprint, including how and where we work, to reduce our expense growth. As you can see from our earnings release, we incurred $207 million in accelerated rent and depreciation in the third quarter related to these actions. Third, we have engineering workstreams underway to improve productivity across Alphabet. Given the magnitude of investment in our technical infrastructure, we have a superb team focused on efficiency of our operations there. We are also making progress in streamlining operations across Alphabet through the use of AI. Finally, there are ongoing workstreams that are improving the efficiency of our spend with suppliers and vendors through our central procurement organization. And to be clear, across the portfolio of Other Bets companies, we have also been working to identify opportunities to create sharper focus and to operate more efficiently and effectively. With respect to sequential quarter-on-quarter trends, two further points: First, Cost of Sales in the fourth quarter will reflect both higher hardware costs given Pixel family launches, as well as increased CAC for YouTube as previously noted. Second, as usual, we expect Sales and Marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the end of the year in part to support product launches and the holiday season. Finally, our reported capex in Q3 was $8 billion, driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component for servers, followed by data centers, reflecting a meaningful increase in our investments in AI compute. The growth in reported cash capex in Q3 is somewhat muted due to the timing of supplier payments, which can cause variability from quarter to quarter. We continue to invest meaningfully in the technical infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see in AI across Alphabet and expect elevated levels of investment, increasing in the fourth quarter of 2023 and continuing to grow in 2024. In closing, we remain very excited about the opportunities ahead and committed to deliver sustainable financial value. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions. As a reminder, to ask a question you will need to press star *1 on your telephone. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been asked. And our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is somewhat of a jump ball. There is somewhat of an investor debate about the incremental return on capital to Search when it comes to AI. I know it’s early, but are there any examples that you’re seeing with SGE or Bard on higher utility, higher conversion rates, more engagement? Just something to sort of show signal around the return that could come from these investments? And the second one, Ruth, I know you have spoken a lot about durably re-engineering the cost base. I think in the past you talked about how expenses could grow slower than revenue in 2024. Is that sort of still the high-level way to think about it, or is that potentially changing a bit as investments are continuing? Thanks. Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Ruth, do you want to take the second part, I’ll take the first? Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: Sure. Thanks for that, Brian. Overall, that’s sort of a truism, as you know well, that looking to grow revenues at a faster rate than expenses as we’re focused on delivering sustainable financial value, and so that really takes us to the workstreams which I tried to tick through again. Those remain the driver. They’re the real priority. Those are the efforts that are going to enable us to keep expense growth as moderated as possible while supporting the investment growth that is so exciting in front of us, in particular around AI. <mark>Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: To your first part, obviously, we see AI as a foundational platform shift and are excited about the opportunities across our business.</mark> It starts with Search. I’ve been pretty pleased with how the user feedback has been on SGE. We are rolling it out to more users. Through it all, we’re making sure the product works well and we are generating value for our ecosystem and that Ads transitions well. I think I view this as, with AI, the opportunity to evolve Search and Assistant over the next decade ahead. And I think as we’ve always seen, when you continue to invest and build great experiences, you can get value on the other side. And I do think over time there will be newer paths, just like we’ve done on YouTube. I think with the AI work, there are subscription models as a possible path as well. Obviously, all of the AI investments we’re doing applies across Cloud, too, and I’m pretty optimistic about what’s ahead there as well. Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley): Great. Thank you, both. Operator: Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Doug Anmuth (JPMorgan): Thanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, you talked a lot about AI. I was hoping you could talk more about Gemini and how it will differentiate from other models -- some of the multimodal capabilities and what new experiences or [agents] you think it could unlock and how we should think about timing. And then also just on Cloud, hoping you can talk about some of the factors there on the decel in Cloud and just what you’re seeing in terms of optimizations, and is there any sign of new workload deployments taking place? Thanks. Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: Thanks, good questions. So on Gemini, obviously, it’s an effort from our combined Google DeepMind team. I’m very excited at the progress there and as we’re working through getting the model ready. To me, more importantly, we are just really laying the foundation of what I think of as the next-generation series of models we’ll be launching all throughout 2024. The pace of innovation is extraordinarily impressive to see. We are creating it from the ground up to be multimodal, highly efficient with tool and API integrations, and more importantly, laying the platform to enable future innovations as well. We are developing Gemini in a way that it is going to be available at various sizes and capabilities, and we’ll be using it immediately across all our products internally as well as bringing it out to both developers and Cloud customers through Vertex. So I view it as a journey, and each generation is going to be better than the other. And we are definitely investing, and the early results are very promising. On Cloud, maybe what I would say is, overall, we have definitely started seeing customers looking to optimize spend. We leaned into it to help customers, given some of the challenges they were facing, and so that was a factor. But we are definitely seeing a lot of interest in AI. There are many, many projects underway now. Just on Vertex alone, the number of projects grew over 7X. And so we see signs of stabilization, and I’m optimistic about what’s ahead. Operator: Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Eric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs): Thank you very much for taking the questions. Two, if I could. <mark>Sundar, you guys led over a year ago starting with Performance Max, and I wanted to know if we could get your updated thoughts on how AI might impact the broader advertising industry and how you are aligning Alphabet and Google’s goals with AI and where it might take the advertising industry in the years ahead.</mark> That would be the first question. And then about a year ago, Philipp and Ruth started talking about some of the brand advertising headwinds that YouTube was facing. As we start to lap those headwinds, how should we be thinking about a broad recovery in brand advertising versus elements of still headwinds that are being faced in the broader Ads spaces, specifically with YouTube? Thank you. Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: So maybe I take the first one. We are very pleased with how Performance Max is performing. It gives advertisers really a maximum performance across all inventory from one really AI-powered campaign, and it’s probably the ultimate example of AI in action across our Ads products. It’s delivering excellent ROI. Those using it achieve on average over 18% more conversions at a similar cost per action. Since rolling it out about two years ago, we’ve continued to expand the features, give advertisers additional ways to steer how it works. We have a lot of things, like account-level negative keywords, other details here. We launched new lifecycle goals -- customer lifecycle goals, we called them. A revamped asset creation flow that really helps business adapt and scale their most successful creatives. I think that’s one to watch. We will also continue to build other new PMax features based on all the advertiser feedback we’re seeing. So we are very, very encouraged by the progress here. Overall maybe -- there was a second part to your question, a bit on what we’re hearing from the customers out there. Look, driving ROI and efficiency is still top of mind for many, right? It’s a rapidly shifting and still quite unpredictable consumer landscape out there. Our AI tools are very well-received. AI, gen AI are top of mind for everybody really. There’s a ton of excitement, lots of questions about it. Many understand the value. Nearly 80% of our advertisers already use at least one AI-powered Search Ads product. Yeah, we’re hearing a lot of good feedback on, number one, our Ads AI Essentials, which are really helping to unlock the power of AI and set up for durable ROI growth on the advertiser side. Those are products like the foundation for our data and measurement, things like Google Tag, Consent Mode and so on. Obviously Search and PMax, we talked about it, and then all those gen AI products, all those different ones. So there’s a whole lot of interest in those products. Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: Then on to your second question regarding YouTube. As we said, overall, year-on-year growth in revenues was driven by both brand advertising and direct response. But very much to your question, yes, there was a stabilization in spending by advertisers. We’re really pleased about that. We’re particularly pleased about the ongoing performance in the Living Room and on Shorts. And as I said, that’s both watchtime growth and monetization. I would say the other thing benefiting YouTube is the retail strength we talked about with Search -- retail strength in APAC in both Search and YouTube. That really began in the second quarter, continued in the third quarter, but that was another contributor. So quite a number of things going on. Feel good about the results the team was able to deliver here. Eric Sheridan (Goldman Sachs): Thank you so much. Operator: Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley (UBS): Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two, if I can. First, as we just think about the rollout of SGE across the user base, how far along is that? And how do you balance the product rollout and consumer uptake versus monetization in that transition? And then the second one, also sort of generative AI-related, how quickly are you guys finding new ways of optimizing? Whether that’s shrinking model sizes, chip efficiencies or anything else. And do you think overall capital intensity of business scales up, or do you just find ways to do this more efficiently as usage scales? Anything you can share there would be great. Thanks. Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: The first part about SGE, we are still in very early days in terms of how much we have rolled it out. But we have definitely gotten it out to enough people, both geographically, across user segments and enough to know that the product is working well. It improves the experience. But there are areas to improve, which we are fine-tuning. Our true north here is getting at the right user experience we want to, and I’m pretty comfortable seeing the trajectory. And we’ve always worked through these transitions, be it from desktop to mobile or from now, mobile to an AI-enhanced experience. So it’s nothing new, and I feel very comfortable that as we go through it, the strength of our teams -- both on the organic side as well as Ads side -- to drive the right experience for users including Ads will pay dividends. I think we’ll continue to make improvements and make progress there. On your second question, at a high level, I would say all through the -- we just celebrated 25 years -- and of all the things I was proud about, when I looked at the strength of the work we’ve done across our infrastructure as a company, our technical infrastructure as a company, and various given stages at a given moment in time, when we adopted new generations of technology. We’ve looked at the cost of it, but then the curves, the efficiency curves we have driven on top of it, has always been phenomenal to see. And I see the current moment as no different. Already through this year, we are driving significant efficiencies, both in our models, in training costs and serving costs, and our ability to adapt what’s needed to the right use case. And so I think we’ll do everything that is needed to make sure we have the leading AI models and infrastructure in the world, bar none. And we will continue driving efficiencies from there. Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Michael Nathanson (Moffett): Thank you. I’m going to ask you guys a multi-part question on YouTube TV. So, firstly, what were the broader objectives for getting Sunday Ticket? How did it perform versus those objectives? What lessons have you learned from having NFL Sunday Ticket? How does that affect your appetite for more sports going forward? Thanks. Philipp Schindler: So, as Sundar said earlier, we are several weeks into our first season and we are very pleased with how it’s going. I think in the broader context, you have to look at it as our overall YouTube subscription strategy. The great feedback we’ve gotten so far on the YouTube experience is very, very significant. People love the navigation and they love multiview. They love the chats and the polls. And frankly, people are very happy with the lack of latency here. The number one piece of concrete feedback the team has gotten is actually that people want the ability to pick their own games for multiview, which is -- multiview is the awesome feature we started rolling out on YouTube TV that gives fans the ability to basically watch multiple streams here at once. And, yeah, overall, the teams are working hard to build a fantastic experience, and we are really trying to stay focused on getting our first season right and providing the best possible experience really for fans here. Operator: Your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Justin Post (Bank of America): Great. Thank you, a couple questions on Q4. Can you provide any color on if there’s been any pause in advertising around the Middle East conflict in October? Anything we should be aware of for Q4? And then second, when we do think about the Sunday Ticket impact, I know you can’t give us revenues or expenses, but overall, would that be a headwind to margins in Q4 or something we should be thinking about? Thank you. Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: So look, on the first question, obviously this is a tragic, tragic -- there are no words to talk about what’s going on. And all of our focus has been on supporting our people there and how our products can be as helpful as possible in this very painful time, broadly. And so nothing really to add. And then in terms of the second question, Sunday Ticket, the only thing I tried to call out there is that clearly this is the first full quarter of Sunday Ticket that is contributing overall to the subscription revenues that we see. That’s in part of Other Revenues. Also obviously, it is contributing to higher CAC in the fourth quarter. So tried to make that really clear. And as we look longer term, we expect to generate an attractive return over the life of the deal. We’re continuing to invest in support of this. And excited about the additional opportunities that come out of it working with partners to deliver clips and other opportunities. As we’ve said, we’ve heard positive feedback from our partners at the NFL about the new features and livestream reliability. And this is really a clear example of our ability to execute big partnerships with excellence at scale and really leverage a lot of the extraordinary magic at YouTube and across Google. And that’s what we’re excited about. Justin Post (Bank of America): Great, thank you. Operator: Your next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Ken Gawrelski (Wells Fargo): Thank you so much. Two questions, if I may. First, how do you think about the future structure of AI-driven Search capabilities? Will activity remain centralized in a search bar, or will it be decentralized and present in many different applications, including on third-party applications? You alluded to Bard being integrated into multiple Google experiences earlier in the call. And then the second question is, any update on the Chrome cookie deprecation planned to begin in 1Q ’24? What have you seen so far based on your early testing of Privacy Sandbox, and what advertiser feedback have you received? Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google: On your first question, look, you know, I broadly think of it as people are looking for information. They’ve always looked for it in many, many different ways. We’ve given the product search example. People can directly go to Amazon, as an example, or come to Google. If you zoom back and take an information view of the world, there’s always been many different ways to get it. And part of our work we do in making Search be world-class and give users what they’re looking for is so that we can get at as much of that intent as possible. So I don’t see that changing. With mobile, there were more ways that people could get information, but we worked hard to make Search work better in the mobile world. And similarly, I view with AI, there will be many ways people get information. But it also offers us an opportunity in Search and in Assistant to take it to the next level and answer use cases, which we couldn’t have done before, and expand a diverse set of needs where we are a source. So that’s how I see the opportunity ahead. Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google: And to the second part of your question: yes, Chrome still plans to begin phasing out third-party cookies in the second half of ’24. In the last several months, Chrome has really made significant progress on the Privacy Sandbox with APIs for developer testing. And they are now generally available in Chrome. Our Ads team is testing these APIs. And as we shared back in April, the preliminary results of our interest-based ads testing showed a combination of what we call privacy-preserving signals and AI optimization actually provides positive results for businesses preparing for a cookieless future. We also recently announced that in Q1 of ’24 we plan to deprecate third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users, and this will support developers, obviously, in conducting their real-world experiments to assess the readiness and effectiveness of their products without third-party cookies. And we’re overall encouraged by the ecosystem engagement on Privacy Sandbox. We’ll continue to work with the industry and regulators in how these technologies can support the transition to, frankly, a more private web. Operator: And our last question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney (Evercore ISI): Thank you. Two questions, please. Ruth, you talked about these elevated levels of investments in Q4 and in ’24. I’m sorry, were you referring to just CapEx or CapEx and total expenses? And then on the comments around stabilization in Cloud, is this something that you just started to see in the September quarter, or had you seen that starting earlier in the year? And if you just started seeing it in the September quarter, would you have any thoughts on why you would have seen it, why Google Cloud would have seen it maybe later than some of the other hyperscalers? Thank you. Ruth Porat, President and Chief Investment Officer; CFO, Alphabet and Google: So I think what you’re referring to was my CapEx comment. I was trying to make the point that we are committed to meaningfully investing in CapEx, given all the opportunities we see. We do continue to expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. It will be increasing in the fourth quarter. And talked about some of the difference in timing, muted timing in the third quarter due to the timing of supplier payments. And then tried to make it clear that we will continue to grow CapEx in 2024 -- or more specifically to your question, 2024 aggregate CapEx will be above the full year 2023. So that was the main one. And then as it relates to Cloud, as Sundar said, what we’re really excited about is the revenue growth does reflect healthy customer adoption across the portfolio, and that’s Infrastructure, Data Analytics, it’s Security. And so I can’t comment on others, but we feel good about where we’re sitting here and looking forward. And we’ll let you do the forecasting. GCP growth in the third quarter was above the growth rate for Cloud overall, and we feel really good about the work that they’re doing there. And then, of course, in addition to that is all of the contribution from Google Workspace. Operator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks. Jim Friedland, Director Investor Relations: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter 2023 call. Thank you and have a good evening. Operator: Thank you, everyone. This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

              "'Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP) today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\\n\\n“Our revenue returned to positive growth in Q3, increasing 5% year-over-year and flowing through to positive adjusted EBITDA as our reprioritized cost structure demonstrated the leverage in our business model,” said Evan Spiegel, CEO. “We are focused on improving our advertising platform to drive higher return on investment for our advertising partners, and we have evolved our go-to-market efforts to better serve our partners and drive customer success.”\\n\\nJerry Hunter, Chief Operating Officer, has notified Snap that he will retire. Mr. Hunter joined Snap seven years ago and served an important role in building the company’s engineering and business structures. Mr. Hunter’s duties and responsibilities will be transitioned by the end of the month and he will continue to support Snap through July 1, 2024 to help ensure this transition is effective.\\n\\n“I am deeply grateful to Jerry for the meaningful contributions he has made over his many years at Snap,” said Evan Spiegel. “His work to improve our advertising platform, serve our community, and build a strong team has helped lay the foundation for our future growth.”\\n\\nSnap Inc. also announced today its board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $500 million of its Class A common stock. Repurchases of the Class A common stock may be made from time to time, either through open market transactions (including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans) or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including stock price, trading volume, market and economic conditions, and other general business considerations. Repurchases under the program have been authorized for 12 months but the program may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time.\\n\\nThe goal of the program is to utilize the company’s strong balance sheet to opportunistically offset a portion of the dilution related to the issuance of restricted stock units to employees as part of the overall compensation program designed to foster an ownership culture.\\n\\nRepurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2023, Snap had $3.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\\n• Revenue was $1,189 million, compared to $1,128 million in the prior year, an increase of 5% year-over-year.\\n• Net loss was $368 million, compared to $360 million in the prior year.\\n• Adjusted EBITDA was $40 million, compared to $73 million in the prior year.\\n• Operating cash flow was $13 million, compared to $56 million in the prior year.\\n• Free Cash Flow was $(61) million, compared to $18 million in the prior year.\\n• Trailing twelve months operating cash flow was $207 million and trailing twelve months Free Cash Flow was $2 million.\\n\\nWe grew and deepened our engagement with our community:\\n• DAUs were 406 million in Q3 2023, an increase of 43 million, or 12%, year-over-year.\\n• Since launching My AI, our AI-powered chatbot, over 200 million people have sent over 20 billion messages, which we believe makes My AI among the most widely used AI chatbots available today.\\n• We launched our new Generative AI powered feature called Dreams, which enables Snapchatters to create generative AI selfies.\\n• We are seeing more creators posting content to Snapchat, with nearly three times more public Stories posted in the US compared to Q3 2022.\\n\\nWe are focused on accelerating and diversifying our revenue growth:\\n• We returned to positive revenue growth this quarter as we continue to execute against our strategy of accelerating and diversifying our revenue growth.\\n• During Q3, we implemented over 17 major machine learning ranking and optimization improvements for App, Web, and Dynamic Product Ad (DPA) optimization goals.\\n• We launched our Total Takeover solution, which includes First Commercial, First Lens, and First Story, and lets advertisers reserve the first Commercial, Lens, or Snap Ad a Snapchatter sees.\\n• Snapchat+, our subscription service that offers exclusive, experimental, and pre-release features, reached over 5 million subscribers in Q3 2023.\\n• We integrated with Shopify Audiences, which enables Shopify Plus merchants to extend their reach and find new customers on Snapchat who have high intent to purchase their products.\\n• At our 2023 Beauty Summit in September, we announced new advertising tools for beauty brands such as beauty AR Lenses and Bitmoji beauty drops.\\n\\nWe invested in our augmented reality platform:\\n• We launched the Real-Time Neural Rendering ML Model in Lens Studio, which enables developers to build AR assets from 2D images captured on a phone.\\n• We launched Diffuse Indirect Lighting, a new Ray Tracing feature that brings a level of realism to how colors and lights reflect and glow onto other objects.\\n• We introduced Lens Creator Rewards, a new opportunity for Snap AR creators, developers, and teams to be rewarded for building top-performing Lenses on Snapchat.\\n• We partnered with MTV for their 2023 Video Music Awards to let the audience live cast their vote for the Best New Artist category through an innovative Snapchat Lens via Camera Kit.\\n• For the 2023 NFL season, we partnered with the LA Rams and Disguise to deliver a sponsored Princess Cruises AR experience powered by Camera Kit in SoFi Stadium.\\n• This summer, our AR technology enhanced music festivals across the world, including AR experiences for Lollapalooza Paris, in partnership with Live Nation.\\n• For the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup, we debuted a USWNT “Team Tracker” AR Lens that used advanced AR technology, with 3D Bitmoji avatars, stats, news, fun facts, and highlights that updated in real time.\\n\\nAs we enter Q4, we anticipate continued growth in our global community and, as a result, our financial forecast for Q4 is built on the assumption that DAU will reach 410 million to 412 million. We believe we are on the right path with our direct-response advertising platform and are focused on executing against our roadmap to deliver further improvements. That said, forward visibility of advertising demand remains limited due to several factors. First, revenue in Q4 is historically backweighted, and the revenue mix in Q4 has historically included a relatively higher share from brand advertising revenue, and brand advertising grew at a slower rate than direct-response advertising in Q3. In addition, we observed pauses in spending from a large number of primarily brand-oriented advertising campaigns immediately following the onset of the war in the Middle East, and this has been a headwind to revenue quarter-to-date. While some of these campaigns have now resumed, and the impact on our revenue has partially diminished, we continue to observe new pauses and the risk that these pauses could persist or increase in magnitude remains. Due to the unpredictable nature of war, we believe it would be imprudent to provide formal guidance for Q4. Our internal forecast assumes a revenue range of $1,320 million to $1,375 million, implying year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 2% to 6%. Within this range of revenue, we estimate that adjusted EBITDA will be between $65 million and $105 million.\\n\\nSnap Inc. will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:30 p.m. Pacific / 5:30 p.m. Eastern today. The live audio webcast along with supplemental information will be accessible at investor.snap.com. A recording of the webcast will also be available following the conference call.\\n\\nSnap Inc. uses its websites (including snap.com and investor.snap.com) as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligation under Regulation FD.\\n\\nFree Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, reduced by purchases of property and equipment.\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), excluding interest income; interest expense, other income (expense), net; income tax benefit (expense); depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; payroll and other tax expense related to stock-based compensation; and certain other non-cash or non-recurring items impacting net income (loss) from time to time.\\n\\nA Daily Active User (DAU) is defined as a registered Snapchat user who opens the Snapchat application at least once during a defined 24-hour period. We calculate average DAUs for a particular quarter by adding the number of DAUs on each day of that quarter and dividing that sum by the number of days in that quarter.\\n\\nAverage revenue per user (ARPU) is defined as quarterly revenue divided by the average DAUs.\\n\\nA Monthly Active User (MAU) is defined as a registered Snapchat user who opens the Snapchat application at least once during the 30-day period ending on the calendar month-end. We calculate average Monthly Active Users for a particular quarter by calculating the average of the MAUs as of each calendar month-end in that quarter.\\n\\nNote: For adjustments and additional information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures and other items discussed, please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” and “Supplemental Financial Information and Business Metrics.”\\n\\nSnap Inc. is a technology company. We believe the camera presents the greatest opportunity to improve the way people live and communicate. We contribute to human progress by empowering people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together.

All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this press release, including statements regarding guidance, our future results of operations or financial condition, future stock repurchase programs or stock dividends, business strategy and plans, user growth and engagement, product initiatives, objectives of management for future operations, and advertiser and partner offerings, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “going to,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” or “would” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions. We caution you that the foregoing may not include all of the forward-looking statements made in this press release.\\n\\nYou should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this press release primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends, including our financial outlook, macroeconomic uncertainty, and geo-political conflicts, that we believe may continue to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties related to: our financial performance; our ability to attain and sustain profitability; our ability to generate and sustain positive cash flow; our ability to attract and retain users, partners, and advertisers; competition and new market entrants; managing our growth and future expenses; compliance with new laws, regulations, and executive actions; our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property; our ability to succeed in existing and new market segments; our ability to attract and retain qualified team members and key personnel; our ability to repay or refinance outstanding debt, or to access additional financing; future acquisitions, divestitures, or investments; and the potential adverse impact of climate change, natural disasters, health epidemics, macroeconomic conditions, and war or other armed conflict, as well as risks, uncertainties, and other factors described in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our most recent periodic report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, which is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will be made available in our periodic report that will be filed with the SEC for the period covered by this press release and other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC. In addition, any forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, including future developments related to geo-political conflicts and macroeconomic conditions, except as required by law.\\n\\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\\n\\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measure of Free Cash Flow, which is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, reduced by purchases of property and equipment. We believe Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available, after capital expenditures, for operational expenses and investment in our business and is a key financial indicator used by management. Additionally, we believe that Free Cash Flow is an important measure since we use third-party infrastructure partners to host our services and therefore we do not incur significant capital expenditures to support revenue generating activities. Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet and invest in future growth.\\n\\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income (loss); excluding interest income; interest expense; other income (expense), net; income tax benefit (expense); depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; payroll and other tax expense related to stock-based compensation; and certain other non-cash or non-recurring items impacting net income (loss) from time to time. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in Adjusted EBITDA.\\n\\nWe use the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP net income (loss), which is defined as net income (loss); excluding amortization of intangible assets; stock-based compensation expense; payroll and other tax expense related to stock-based compensation; certain other non-cash or non-recurring items impacting net income (loss) from time to time; and related income tax adjustments. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and weighted average diluted shares are then used to calculate non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share. Similar to Adjusted EBITDA, we believe these measures help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses we exclude in the measure.\\n\\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We are presenting these non-GAAP measures to assist investors in seeing our financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry.\\n\\nFor a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\\n\\nSnap Inc., “Snapchat,” and our other registered and common law trade names, trademarks, and service marks are the property of Snap Inc. or our subsidiaries.'"

              " Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP) today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. “Our revenue returned to positive growth in Q3, increasing 5% year-over-year and flowing through to positive adjusted EBITDA as our reprioritized cost structure demonstrated the leverage in our business model,” said Evan Spiegel, CEO. “We are focused on improving our advertising platform to drive higher return on investment for our advertising partners, and we have evolved our go-to-market efforts to better serve our partners and drive customer success.”\n",
              "\n",
              "Jerry Hunter, Chief Operating Officer, has notified Snap that he will retire. Mr. Hunter joined Snap seven years ago and served an important role in building the company’s engineering and business structures. Mr. Hunter’s duties and responsibilities will be transitioned by the end of the month and he will continue to support Snap through July 1, 2024 to help ensure this transition is effective. “I am deeply grateful to Jerry for the meaningful contributions he has made over his many years at Snap,” said Evan Spiegel. “His work to improve our advertising platform, serve our community, and build a strong team has helped lay the foundation for our future growth.”\n",
              "\n",
              "Snap Inc. also announced today its board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $500 million of its Class A common stock. Repurchases of the Class A common stock may be made from time to time, either through open market transactions (including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans) or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including stock price, trading volume, market and economic conditions, and other general business considerations. Repurchases under the program have been authorized for 12 months but the program may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time. The goal of the program is to utilize the company’s strong balance sheet to opportunistically offset a portion of the dilution related to the issuance of restricted stock units to employees as part of the overall compensation program designed to foster an ownership culture. Repurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2023, Snap had $3.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. • Revenue was $1,189 million, compared to $1,128 million in the prior year, an increase of 5% year-over-year. • Net loss was $368 million, compared to $360 million in the prior year. • Adjusted EBITDA was $40 million, compared to $73 million in the prior year. • Operating cash flow was $13 million, compared to $56 million in the prior year. • Free Cash Flow was $(61) million, compared to $18 million in the prior year. • Trailing twelve months operating cash flow was $207 million and trailing twelve months Free Cash Flow was $2 million. We grew and deepened our engagement with our community:\n",
              "• DAUs were 406 million in Q3 2023, an increase of 43 million, or 12%, year-over-year. • Since launching My AI, our AI-powered chatbot, over 200 million people have sent over 20 billion messages, which we believe makes My AI among the most widely used AI chatbots available today. • We launched our new Generative AI powered feature called Dreams, which enables Snapchatters to create generative AI selfies. • We are seeing more creators posting content to Snapchat, with nearly three times more public Stories posted in the US compared to Q3 2022. We are focused on accelerating and diversifying our revenue growth:\n",
              "• We returned to positive revenue growth this quarter as we continue to execute against our strategy of accelerating and diversifying our revenue growth. • During Q3, we implemented over 17 major machine learning ranking and optimization improvements for App, Web, and Dynamic Product Ad (DPA) optimization goals. <mark>• We launched our Total Takeover solution, which includes First Commercial, First Lens, and First Story, and lets advertisers reserve the first Commercial, Lens, or Snap Ad a Snapchatter sees.</mark> • Snapchat+, our subscription service that offers exclusive, experimental, and pre-release features, reached over 5 million subscribers in Q3 2023. • We integrated with Shopify Audiences, which enables Shopify Plus merchants to extend their reach and find new customers on Snapchat who have high intent to purchase their products. • At our 2023 Beauty Summit in September, we announced new advertising tools for beauty brands such as beauty AR Lenses and Bitmoji beauty drops. We invested in our augmented reality platform:\n",
              "• We launched the Real-Time Neural Rendering ML Model in Lens Studio, which enables developers to build AR assets from 2D images captured on a phone. • We launched Diffuse Indirect Lighting, a new Ray Tracing feature that brings a level of realism to how colors and lights reflect and glow onto other objects. • We introduced Lens Creator Rewards, a new opportunity for Snap AR creators, developers, and teams to be rewarded for building top-performing Lenses on Snapchat. • We partnered with MTV for their 2023 Video Music Awards to let the audience live cast their vote for the Best New Artist category through an innovative Snapchat Lens via Camera Kit. • For the 2023 NFL season, we partnered with the LA Rams and Disguise to deliver a sponsored Princess Cruises AR experience powered by Camera Kit in SoFi Stadium. • This summer, our AR technology enhanced music festivals across the world, including AR experiences for Lollapalooza Paris, in partnership with Live Nation. <mark>• For the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup, we debuted a USWNT “Team Tracker” AR Lens that used advanced AR technology, with 3D Bitmoji avatars, stats, news, fun facts, and highlights that updated in real time.</mark> As we enter Q4, we anticipate continued growth in our global community and, as a result, our financial forecast for Q4 is built on the assumption that DAU will reach 410 million to 412 million. We believe we are on the right path with our direct-response advertising platform and are focused on executing against our roadmap to deliver further improvements. That said, forward visibility of advertising demand remains limited due to several factors. First, revenue in Q4 is historically backweighted, and the revenue mix in Q4 has historically included a relatively higher share from brand advertising revenue, and brand advertising grew at a slower rate than direct-response advertising in Q3. In addition, we observed pauses in spending from a large number of primarily brand-oriented advertising campaigns immediately following the onset of the war in the Middle East, and this has been a headwind to revenue quarter-to-date. While some of these campaigns have now resumed, and the impact on our revenue has partially diminished, we continue to observe new pauses and the risk that these pauses could persist or increase in magnitude remains. Due to the unpredictable nature of war, we believe it would be imprudent to provide formal guidance for Q4. Our internal forecast assumes a revenue range of $1,320 million to $1,375 million, implying year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 2% to 6%. Within this range of revenue, we estimate that adjusted EBITDA will be between $65 million and $105 million. Snap Inc. will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:30 p.m. Pacific / 5:30 p.m. Eastern today. The live audio webcast along with supplemental information will be accessible at investor.snap.com. A recording of the webcast will also be available following the conference call.

Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, reduced by purchases of property and equipment. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), excluding interest income; interest expense, other income (expense), net; income tax benefit (expense); depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; payroll and other tax expense related to stock-based compensation; and certain other non-cash or non-recurring items impacting net income (loss) from time to time. A Daily Active User (DAU) is defined as a registered Snapchat user who opens the Snapchat application at least once during a defined 24-hour period. We calculate average DAUs for a particular quarter by adding the number of DAUs on each day of that quarter and dividing that sum by the number of days in that quarter. Average revenue per user (ARPU) is defined as quarterly revenue divided by the average DAUs. A Monthly Active User (MAU) is defined as a registered Snapchat user who opens the Snapchat application at least once during the 30-day period ending on the calendar month-end. We calculate average Monthly Active Users for a particular quarter by calculating the average of the MAUs as of each calendar month-end in that quarter.

In addition, any forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, including future developments related to geo-political conflicts and macroeconomic conditions, except as required by law. To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. We use the non-GAAP financial measure of Free Cash Flow, which is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, reduced by purchases of property and equipment. We believe Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available, after capital expenditures, for operational expenses and investment in our business and is a key financial indicator used by management. Additionally, we believe that Free Cash Flow is an important measure since we use third-party infrastructure partners to host our services and therefore we do not incur significant capital expenditures to support revenue generating activities. Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet and invest in future growth. We use the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income (loss); excluding interest income; interest expense; other income (expense), net; income tax benefit (expense); depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; payroll and other tax expense related to stock-based compensation; and certain other non-cash or non-recurring items impacting net income (loss) from time to time. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in Adjusted EBITDA. We use the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP net income (loss), which is defined as net income (loss); excluding amortization of intangible assets; stock-based compensation expense; payroll and other tax expense related to stock-based compensation; certain other non-cash or non-recurring items impacting net income (loss) from time to time; and related income tax adjustments. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and weighted average diluted shares are then used to calculate non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share. Similar to Adjusted EBITDA, we believe these measures help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses we exclude in the measure. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We are presenting these non-GAAP measures to assist investors in seeing our financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry. <mark>For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n",

        "## Recommendations\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the conclusions drawn from Google's earnings transcript, here are the top three recommendations for someone considering investment:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Invest in AI-Integrated Advertising Platforms:**\n",
        "  - Given the significant role of AI in transforming the advertising landscape, investing in companies that are integrating AI into their advertising platforms can be a strategic move. Look for companies, like Google, that are at the forefront of AI development and are applying these advancements to optimize advertising campaigns. These companies are likely to stay competitive and offer innovative solutions in the rapidly evolving digital advertising market.\n",
        "2. **Focus on Companies with Diverse Advertising Channels:**\n",
        "  - Diversifying investments across companies that offer a range of advertising channels, including video, image, and conversational ad experiences, can be beneficial. This diversification aligns with the trend of integrated advertising campaigns. Companies that have a broad reach across platforms, like Google with its access to YouTube and the wider Google network, are positioned to capture a larger audience and deliver more effective advertising solutions.\n",
        "3. **Prioritize Firms with a Strong Emphasis on Long-Term Growth Areas:**\n",
        "  - Target companies that have identified and are investing in key areas for long-term growth, such as AI, retail, and new media platforms like YouTube. These areas are likely to drive future advancements and revenue growth in the advertising sector. Firms that are not only innovating but also strategically aligning their goals with future industry trends, like Alphabet and Google, may offer more sustainable investment opportunities.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, an investment strategy that focuses on companies leveraging AI in advertising, offering diverse ad channels, and strategically investing in future growth areas could capitalize on the emerging trends and potential opportunities in the digital advertising space. As always, it's important to conduct thorough research and possibly consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions."
